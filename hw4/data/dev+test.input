right - wing populists triumph in austria , have  |||  total  |||  of 29 percent
according to the first preliminary results of the early parliament elections in austria have brought about a perceptible weakening of both parties in the present large coalition and a  |||  significant  |||  boost for the right - wing populist parties .
the austrian people 's party ( övp ) , where the position of the  |||  current  |||  head , wilhelm molterer , is being severely jolted , suffered particularly great losses .
conversely , the campaign leader of the alliance for the future of austria ( bzö ) , carinthian governor jörg haider , is preparing a triumphant return to  |||  national  |||  politics .
according to the preliminary results , the social democratic party ( spö ) remains the strongest in the country with 29.8 percent of votes , however , it has  |||  lost  |||  5.5 percent of votes since the last elections in 2006 .
övp , which with its 25.6 percent loses nearly nine percent of  |||  votes  |||  , fared even worse .
these are the worst results of both  |||  large  |||  parties in austrian post - war history , and particularly for the people 's party , who urged the early elections , it is literally a catastrophic result .
at the beginning of july , when övp left the coalition , the people 's party still had a  |||  significant  |||  lead on spö in the polls .
voters , however , apparently punished them for letting the  |||  government  |||  flounder .
such a development would certainly simplify the journey toward the increasingly most likely recourse from the election results , that is , the renewal of the  |||  large  |||  coalition of spö and övp .
given the strengthening of both right - wing populist parties - the freedom party ( fpö ) gained a preliminary 18 percent and bzö eleven percent of the votes - however , at the same time , the social democrats expressed fear of a repetition of the year 1999 , when the people 's party  |||  agreed  |||  with the populists ( fpö was still united at that time , it broke away from bzö in 2005 ) on a common government , which eventually provoked sanctions from the european union .
haider , who has already announced that he is  |||  prepared  |||  to work together with any party and presumes he will return to vienna to national politics , is evidently banking on this development .
the green party also got into the parliament , but suffered a slight loss and fell from third to  |||  fifth  |||  place among austrian political parties .
schwarzenberg :  |||  relations  |||  with india could worsen
according to foreign minister karel schwarzenberg , if it will not be possible to solve the problem of the czech scientists charged in india with the  |||  illegal  |||  collection of beetles , a certain worsening of czech - indian relations could take place .
the minister made this statement in new york following today 's  |||  meeting  |||  with his indian counterpart , pranab mukherjee .
" if it is not solved , then yes , then a  |||  certain  |||  worsening would take place , " he states following the meeting initiated from the czech side .
following the negotiations , mukherjee said that it was difficult for the executive branch to intervene in judicial  |||  matters  |||  .
nevertheless , he said that in the case of petr švácha , who was cleared of the charges and penalized with a  |||  fine  |||  , the central government can negotiate with the local government in darjeeling , under the jurisdiction of which the matter belongs .
" his problem could be solved , " the  |||  minister  |||  said .
he can then request to be  |||  released  |||  on bail and wait for the verdict outside of jail , he explained .
schwarzenberg  |||  confirmed  |||  that his partner had also said this during the negotiations .
" he recommends appealing to a higher court , then it would be  |||  possible  |||  to pardon him , " the head of czech diplomacy said .
the only way the czech side can become involved in the whole matter is to  |||  provide  |||  the sentenced individuals with " competent legal support " , the indian minister said .
at the same time , he said that the indian side is already also  |||  providing  |||  them with aid of this type .
" it is in our greatest interest to  |||  maintain  |||  the best relations with india , which have a long - standing tradition .
the indians also  |||  acknowledge  |||  this , " schwarzenberg said .
the minister avoided answering the question of whether he had received a promise from the indian side to pursue the  |||  matter  |||  .
czech referees  |||  battle  |||  for ocean floor
however , he is not interested in the continent , but in a small point  |||  lost  |||  in the blue of the ocean .
at the same time , the area is as large as the continent  |||  itself  |||  , " says italian lawyer luigi santosuosso , who belongs to the thirty - member team of employees of the un division for ocean affairs and the law of the sea .
his boss , the division director , czech lawyer václav mikulka ,  |||  follows  |||  what he is saying and occasionally adds something .
zest and  |||  enthusiasm  |||  for work are dominant here .
the ocean floor shelters a thus far  |||  little  |||  known world rich in natural resources .
it is possible to find oil , ores , and other minerals , but also thus far unknown  |||  living  |||  organisms that hold the key , for example , to the development of a cure for cancer .
a floor  |||  larger  |||  than the continent
coastal  |||  countries  |||  today have begun to vehemently compete for the new underwater territory .
that is , according to a un agreement they are utilizing the rights on which they  |||  agreed  |||  in 1982 in montego bay , jamaica .
this is mainly the area of the so - called continental shelf , which often reaches up to several  |||  hundred  |||  kilometers from the coast of the given country .
the request the given country submits to the commission on the limits of the continental shelf must be supported by scientific and technical documentation  |||  based  |||  on many costly surveys and measurements .
it is the result of many  |||  years  |||  of preparatory work .
" one of our  |||  roles  |||  is to provide the commission with legal and specialized technical assistance .
recently the  |||  success  |||  of australia , which was the first to expand its underwater domain , was registered worldwide .
but new zealand gained as well - the area of the ocean floor that the commission conceded to it is around 1.6 million square kilometers , that is , roughly six times bigger than the size of the country  |||  itself  |||  .
both countries  |||  invested  |||  millions of dollars into surveying .
other countries will also gradually  |||  submit  |||  their requests .
they have until ten years from the  |||  moment  |||  when they ratified the " montego bay agreement " to do so .
where the continental shelf ends , the area of the ocean floor declared by the agreement as the "  |||  common  |||  heritage of humankind " begins .
here no country has any  |||  exclusive  |||  position any longer .
mining rights in this area are  |||  granted  |||  through the agreement established by the international institution .
" but the ocean floor is no klondike " , director mikulka says exaggeratedly , adding that his "  |||  individual  |||  areas are legally clearly delimited and their regime is anchored in contracts . "
czechs in the  |||  pacific  |||
part of the ocean floor  |||  currently  |||  belongs to the czech republic .
it shares it with other countries from the  |||  former  |||  eastern bloc as a part of the common organization " interoceanmetal " .
by agreement , this organization , like the investors of several  |||  small  |||  other countries , gained the status of so - called " pioneering investor " in 1991 .
the area is a rich locality for the collection of poly - metal concretions containing nickel , copper , cobalt and manganese , " says  |||  another  |||  lawyer , pakshi rajan from india .
in solving the hostage crisis , the egyptian government had requested  |||  help  |||  from germany - which sent in the experts .
when push came to shove , the special forces were  |||  ready  |||  , but their services were not required in the end .
more and more  |||  details  |||  are surfacing on the circumstances surrounding the liberation of the eleven european tourists abducted in egypt .
according to the german federal ministries of defense and of the interior , german special forces indirectly took part in the  |||  rescue  |||  mission .
the egyptian government had  |||  accepted  |||  the help offered by germany to rely on the german forces as backup during the operation .
' luckily , it did n't come to that , ' a spokesman of the german  |||  federal  |||  ministry of the interior said .
after their abduction in a  |||  desert  |||  region in the south of egypt , the hostages had been carried back and forth in the border region between egypt , libya , sudan and chad .
german foreign minister steinmeier said they have been entrusted to the care of the  |||  german  |||  embassy .
he did not comment on the  |||  details  |||  of the rescue .
according to german newspaper ' bild , ' the five tourists and the special forces are to board an airbus of the  |||  german  |||  air force , which is said to arrive in germany on tuesday .
u.s.  |||  house  |||  of representatives rejects bailout
the 700 billion dollar  |||  bailout  |||  package for the financial markets narrowly failed to pass in the first of the two chambers of the u.s. congress .
with a vote of 227 to 206 against , the u.s. house of representatives  |||  rejected  |||  the government 's bailout package for the financial markets .
in a dramatic campaign ,  |||  supporters  |||  had made desperate attempts to convince the critics of the 700 billion dollar plan 's merits .
barney frank , one of the main democratic negotiators , had called on representatives for approval , even  |||  though  |||  it was an unpopular plan .
' it 's  |||  hard  |||  to get political approval for the prevention of something that has n't happened yet , ' he conceded .
while the vote was still underway , the dow jones saw a drop of more than six percent , or 600  |||  points  |||  .
for the plan to be implemented , the approval of both the  |||  house  |||  of representatives and the senate is required .
|||  travel  |||  agencies report increase in bookings
it 's going to be a good winter for  |||  german  |||  travel agencies , evidently :
a survey says that the turnover of bookings for the coming months has increased significantly versus the  |||  previous  |||  year - for the winter season by as much as 30 percent , even .
despite prospects of a weak economy , the germans ' appetite for travelling  |||  remains  |||  unspoiled , a survey says .
for bookings during the winter season , travel agencies saw an increase in turnover of 31 percent versus the same period of the previous year , the  |||  german  |||  travel association ( drv ) reported in berlin on monday .
travel agencies had seen an increase in turnover of approximately eleven percent for  |||  october  |||  versus 2007 , the drv said .
in this area , bookings had increased by approximately one  |||  third  |||  , it said .
that aside , it pointed out spain , turkey and greece as being popular among germans , as well as  |||  domestic  |||  regions .
all - inclusive trips were especially sought - after , drv  |||  president  |||  klaus laepple said .
in the light of  |||  increasing  |||  energy and food prices , their cost was ' more calculable for clients than that of individually organized vacations , ' said laepple .
consumers could save money through  |||  early  |||  - bird or all - inclusive discounts , among others , laepple said .
because the summer months had been very well - booked , as well , there would be another  |||  increase  |||  in turnover versus the previous year , he said - although another survey reports that the number of travelling germans sank compared to the previous year .
but there is one thing that connects us : we 've been at the wiesn for barely three minutes , and already the photographers are crowding around us and snapshooting away , filling up their  |||  memory  |||  cards - very flattering , and it 's my first visit to the wiesn , to boot .
the cheapo dirndl  |||  seems  |||  to be doing its job .
almost everyone is wearing dirndl or lederhosn ; nobody looks disgusted or embarrassed - it 's all totally  |||  normal  |||  .
only my dirndl apron drew weird glances at the chocolate -  |||  banana  |||  vendor .
' looks about right , ' she  |||  says  |||  , and laughs .
the  |||  young  |||  man with the exhibitionist attitude is called bob , is from england , and it 's his first time at the oktoberfest , as well .
|||  right  |||  next to one of those fireplugs that everybody mistakes for waste dumps .
|||  others  |||  are n't quite fortunate enough to lose the alcohol in this fashion .
it works like with most wiesn visitors : when it 's empty , they head out , and when it 's  |||  full  |||  , they come back .
' it 's the ones that ca n't take any more , ' one of the paramedics shouted when i asked him about it , disappearing in the  |||  crowd  |||  .
|||  accident  |||  victim named by police
carole paulson , of chelmsford  |||  road  |||  in brentwood , was involved in the accident on friday afternoon on shenfield road in the town .
she was taken to queen 's hospital , romford , but later  |||  died  |||  .
he has since been released on  |||  police  |||  bail .
turkey 's widening  |||  diplomatic  |||  horizons
long before turkey sought to  |||  join  |||  the european union , the european powers were eager to penetrate deep into turkey 's hinterland .
on the eastern side of the bosphorus , maybe just 20 steps into asia , stands one of the finest relics of this  |||  failed  |||  imperial ambition .
hydarpasha railway station was designed by two  |||  german  |||  architects otto ritter and helmut conu in the neo - renaissance style .
the stone is  |||  dirty  |||  .
but  |||  once  |||  inside the vaulted ticket office , there is no doubting the grandeur of the enterprise of which this was the westernmost gateway .
the station was  |||  opened  |||  in august 1908 by a german consortium , the anatolia - baghdad corporation .
germany , a latecomer to the imperial game , intended to realise its ambitions to dominate the middle east by means of this railway running to damascus , baghdad , and  |||  beyond  |||  into what today is saudi arabia .
but germany 's imperial ambitions foundered during the  |||  world  |||  war i.
british and dominion forces advanced out of egypt and pushed the turks and their  |||  german  |||  allies out of palestine and syria .
and there was bad  |||  news  |||  for hyderpasha station too .
in 1917 an ammunition  |||  train  |||  blew up destroying its elaborate roof .
|||  turkish  |||  sources say it was sabotage .
since then it has slowly mouldered away , largely bypassed by  |||  history  |||  .
the  |||  governing  |||  justice and development party - the akp - has crafted a whole new foreign policy for the country .
remarkably the turkish government has good relations with israel and syria , with the  |||  palestinian  |||  factions of hamas and fatah , with iraq and iran and of course with the european union and the united states .
to gauge the parameters of this new foreign policy , i boarded the night sleeper to the turkish capital ankara , to visit one of the akp 's  |||  leading  |||  foreign policy experts , turkish mp suat kiniklioglu .
the next morning - some ten and a half hours later - after a jolting ride along tracks that produced the old world cadences of the famous documentary the night mail , i arrived in the turkish capital -  |||  proposed  |||  as a new city for a new secular state intent on turning its back on the ottoman past .
but the akp with its well -  |||  known  |||  islamist roots represents a paradigm shift in the turkish consensus .
it has prompted some suspicion in the  |||  west  |||  , most notably in washington .
suat kiniklioglu could have been a centre - right politician from almost any other  |||  political  |||  party in europe .
suit , tie , i am  |||  sure  |||  he was even packing a blackberry .
|||  turkey  |||  had been cut off from its hinterland .
today it had to  |||  look  |||  eastwards and westwards at the same time .
" but surely at some  |||  point  |||  , " i asked , " turkey might be forced to choose ? "
" turkey , " he said , " did not want to have to face that  |||  choice  |||  . "
he then stressed a point that almost everyone i have spoken to here has recited almost by rote : turkey 's ties not just to the middle east , but to the caucasus , and around the black sea , are as much to the  |||  benefit  |||  of europe and the united states as they are to turkey .
how surprised they would have been to find that europe 's  |||  middle  |||  eastern ambitions may now , to a large part , be in turkey 's hands .
and as i waited at the terminal for the ferry to take me  |||  back  |||  across the bosphorus , i recalled that in those days turkey had always been called " the sick man of europe . "
then at least there did not  |||  seem  |||  to be much doubt as to which continent should lay claim to this fascinating country .
mark brown writes : as guildford 's musical director from 1962 , vernon " tod " handley ( obituary , sept 11 ) had  |||  charge  |||  of the guildford philharmonic orchestra and choir .
as part of his music  |||  scheme  |||  for the borough , in the next year he founded his wonderful youth choir , proteus .
it was supposed to be for under - 21s , but by the time the proteus sang its finale in 1979 ,  |||  several  |||  of us were in our late 20s - we just refused to give the choir up .
the name " proteus " ( the mythological shape - changer ) represented the choir 's willingness and ability to tackle whatever music was  |||  presented  |||  to it , whether madrigal or messiaen , whether unaccompanied or with full orchestra .
the musical versatility produced by such a youth choir was often astonishing , always exciting , and it was all due to the inspiration of that one man and the enthusiasm for the music which remained absolutely constant  |||  throughout  |||  the years .
how often we were told by tod to " let the music  |||  speak  |||  for itself " .
he 'd say : " the composer knows what he  |||  wants  |||  .
it 's all there in the  |||  music  |||  .
his baton technique was absolutely  |||  clear  |||  and precise , though never dictatorial , nor florid .
|||  john  |||  frayn turner writes :
over the  |||  past  |||  40 - odd years , i have reviewed more than 100 of his concerts and i can honestly say that i have never been disappointed with a single one - and many times inspired by them .
tod handley had that rare combination of greatness plus  |||  personal  |||  modesty .
he hated conductors who , in his words , simply " hawked one or two well - known war horses around the  |||  world  |||  " .
he will be  |||  missed  |||  by so many of us .
|||  william  |||  woodruff
professor  |||  john  |||  beckett writes :
your obituary of william woodruff ( sept 25 ) states that " in 1946 he resumed  |||  economic  |||  history at oxford and in 1950 became a houblon - norman research fellow ... while simultaneously studying for a bsc , an ma and a phd " .
this follows from woodruff 's author 's  |||  note  |||  in beyond nab end , but it is not correct .
from 1946 to 1953 he was a lecturer in  |||  economic  |||  history at the university of nottingham , during which time he completed a phd thesis on the british rubber industry , supervised by professor j. d. chambers , and subsequently published in 1958 as the british rubber industry .
in 1953 he  |||  left  |||  nottingham permanently for illinois .
" i recommend the exhibition of josé vicente resino " flamenco y vida , " because his black and white photographs , taken in  |||  documentary  |||  style , are extraordinary .
resino is able to capture magic  |||  moments  |||  . "
in addition , it is equipped with a fine mechanics which increases the driving comfort and permits to  |||  save  |||  fuel .

this is honda jazz '  |||  second  |||  generation .
while aesthetically the new jazz looks like the  |||  previous  |||  model , changes brought to the minivan are numerous .
among others , it is worth pointing out its  |||  innovative  |||  design , new platform , bigger size and pretty new mechanics .
anyway , before moving on to analyze the new model , may be useful to point out that this new jazz  |||  comes  |||  only six years after the entry of the first generation .
even if the jazz model is less  |||  known  |||  in europe than in other markets , it remains a phenomenon in terms of sales .
just there , almost a million units of jazz were  |||  sold  |||  from the model 's launch .
the second  |||  market  |||  was the old continent , with about half a million units sold in six years .
despite these numbers , honda believes this new jazz will increase even more its  |||  sales  |||  in the segment .
so , if in 2007 the japanese company  |||  sold  |||  a total of 83,000 units of this model , in 2009 it estimates it will be around 100,000 cars . this foresee a possible increase in sales of 17 % just in the european market .
regarding the spanish market , honda has  |||  sold  |||  a total of 8,000 units of jazz since 2002 , corresponding to 6.7 % of total sales for the company in spain .
the arrival of the new honda jazz will probably make it possible , by reducing the lowering of  |||  sales  |||  in spain to a large extent .
despite the increase in sales , honda has also incremented its market  |||  share  |||  in spain , reaching the 1.8 % , compared to the last year 1.6 % .
at the same time , the  |||  japanese  |||  company expects to reach the 2 % in 2010 .
to achieve this , honda is confident in  |||  another  |||  new model of its .
this is insight , a hybrid five - door compact car , 4.37 meters in length . the  |||  japanese  |||  company hopes to sell about 200,000 units of this model worldwide , within one year .
according to the markets and  |||  japanese  |||  manufacturers ' estimates , the 50 % of insight 's sale will come from the united states , while the remaining 50 % will be from both the old continent and japan .
the commercial launch of insight is planned for the  |||  early  |||  next year , shortly after the presentation of the model inside the company in january in valenza .
it reaches now 3,90 meters  |||  length  |||  ( five centimetres more ) , 1,69 meters width ( two centimetres more ) and its interaxle 2,50 meters , with an increment of five centimetres .
its 1,52  |||  meters  |||  height , still , remained unchanged .
other improvements - in addition to external elements , such as the rear led or the possibility to mount the panoramic glass - concern the improved access to  |||  back  |||  seats .
doors which  |||  allow  |||  access to back seats , open now with an angle of 80 degrees , compared to 67 degrees in the first model .
at the time of marketing , this  |||  small  |||  model will come with a petrol engines of 1.2 or 1.4 litres .
both mechanical systems will include the i - vtec technology which permits a lower fuel consumption , produces less  |||  carbon  |||  dioxide emissions , optimizes the mechanical refinements and , at the same time , maintains high torque engine in all its phases .
the 1.2 litre version reaches a power of 90 hp at 6000 rpm with a  |||  maximum  |||  torque of 114 nm . at 4900 rpm .
the propulsion - which in  |||  previous  |||  jazz reached the 78 hp -- just needs 5.3 litres of fuel and produces around 125 grams of co 2 emissions equivalent .
in developing the technologies for the prevention of accidents , nissan got inspired this time , by  |||  nature  |||  , and especially by bees .
this is the bio - mimetic car robot  |||  drive  |||  , or br 23c , the first step to project technologies for the prevention of collisions .
the engineers of the advanced technical centre of nissan motor co. have developed this little robot in collaboration with the centre for scientific research and technology of the prestigious  |||  university  |||  of tokyo in japan .
according to kazuhiro doi ,  |||  general  |||  director of public relations for the technology , research and development of brand management , the br 23c is an expansion of the security shield of the four areas produced by nissan .
this robot is intended to improve the ability to  |||  prevent  |||  collisions in the vehicles produced by the company .
during the flight ,  |||  each  |||  bee creates its own oval personal space that is very similar to the shield of security developed by nissan .
but the most important element is constituted by the bee 's compound eyes , which can see in all directions with an extra 300 degrees angle ,  |||  allowing  |||  the insect to fly with no interruption inside its personal space .
to recreate these visual features , engineers developed what they defined a laser locator ( laser  |||  range  |||  finder ) .
" when detects an obstacle , the little robot imitates the bee 's movements and change direction immediately by turning the wheels at a right or wider angle to  |||  avoid  |||  the collision .
" if it were not so , the robot would not be able to react quickly enough to  |||  avoid  |||  obstacles " explains toshiyuki andoh , director of the laboratory of mobility and chief engineer of this project .
unlike a bee , the robot can not deviate upwards or downwards , or even diagonally . it can only  |||  move  |||  in two dimensions and in the direction its wheels can turn to . obviously , it cannot run infinite directions and ways like bees do .
for this reason , nissan has used a rotation function in addition to the acceleration and deceleration functions , to permit the little robot can  |||  avoid  |||  collisions .
" this device only needs to process new information  |||  every  |||  few seconds , and acting from this data .
it does not require to store any information or to use the intuitive logic of prior maneuvers . for this reason it can go without interruption supplied only by a few dozen kb of  |||  memory  |||  .
this may surprise , but we are not talking of gigabytes or mega of  |||  memory  |||  . "
the robot  |||  uses  |||  lithium - polymer batteries , which are lighter and more durable than the lithium - ion typology .
do shudder  |||  before  |||  applying for a loan
we have to recognize that the  |||  department  |||  of treasury of the united states , owning quite good capitals to act , certainly does not lack of talent .
having to face the crisis and to  |||  prevent  |||  the americans to be cheated with garbage loans by banks under doubts of insolvency , created a fun and educational game for internet users . this is " bad credit hotel " .
in other words , the " hotel of the bad  |||  credits  |||  " ... or of the problems .
the gloom aspect of this hotel and , in  |||  particular  |||  , of its receptionist aims to push people to think not just once but twice or even three times before applying for a loan .
and above all , to think quite carefully about where applying for it . this is probably the game primary  |||  objective  |||  .
it 's much more a web page for teens than a site for the  |||  general public  |||  .
well , a  |||  dream  |||  - room appears inside the hotel .
it is still something , because about buying a  |||  house  |||  ... better to leave it .
a week after unveiling a provisional  |||  agreement  |||  , the two banks have explained that mufg would buy 9.9 % of morgan stanley shares at a price of 25.25 dollars , totalling three billion dollars .
the selling  |||  price  |||  is less than 19 % of the value of the securities on 31 august .
morgan stanley affirmed that the overall operation would be  |||  based  |||  on an average unit price of 29 dollars , or 28 % above its current price .
" this strategic alliance constitutes an important opportunity to accelerate the transition of morgan stanley to the status of holding bank , " said john mack , the ceo of the  |||  american  |||  group .
morgan stanley has  |||  adopted  |||  this new status last week , which should enable it to diversify its activities but it has to pass through the authority of the federal reserve .
its alliance with mufg also confirms that the current financial crisis  |||  forced  |||  the biggest names on wall street to adopt a much more cautious attitude than before .
the modalities  |||  presented  |||  on monday show that the agreement has been amended in recent days : the previous monday , morgan had just announced it would sell up to 20 % of its shares to the japanese for about $ 8.5 billion .
" a week ago , explained toshihide mizuno , executive director of mufg in tokyo , " we  |||  thought  |||  that the participation would be entirely composed of ordinary shares .
but given the current state of the economy and market , we hoped to minimize the  |||  risks  |||  and to protect our backs . "
|||  based  |||  on the weighted average price mufg will pay for its morgan stanley securities 7 % below their book value .
the agreement foresees that mufg may convert annually half of its preferred securities into  |||  ordinary  |||  shares if these traded more than 50 % above the conversion price , about $ 47 for a given period .
morgan stanley assures that the capital provided by mufg will enable it to seize investment opportunities , strengthen its balance sheet and  |||  increase  |||  its liquidity .
a spokesperson for the group , however ,  |||  refused  |||  to give details on the strategic projects of the two new allies .
after the  |||  investment  |||  of mufg , morgan stanley forecasts a capital ratio tier one of about 15 % , one of the best in the industry .
morgan said to have " significantly "  |||  reduced  |||  its balance sheet since the end of august .
recent weeks have been  |||  difficult  |||  for the group , which saw half its share price melt away while the insurance costs against the risk of default on its debt soared .
this cost reduced on monday but remained at a new high level ,  |||  around  |||  12 % .
rebuilding  |||  around  |||  the republic of the twenty - first century socialism .
this is the  |||  joint  |||  project of the venezuelan hugo chávez , evo morales of bolivia , and the ecuadorian rafael correa .
this sunday , like its counterparts and friends , it is the  |||  third  |||  to put to a vote a draft for a new constitution .
mission accomplished  |||  since  |||  64 % of voters voted " yes " to referendum , according to official results based on 80 % of the votes .
|||  based  |||  on these results , the " no " got 28 % , 7 % of the votes were invalid , and 0.7 % were blank votes .
for the draft  |||  constitution  |||  to be adopted , it should get half the votes plus one .
sunday , two polls conducted outside the polling stations and one non - governmental organization had announced a large victory for the " yes " , of the  |||  range  |||  between 63 % and 70 % .
the " constitution has triumphed so overwhelmingly , " he  |||  assured  |||  , commending the ecuadorians in the government headquarters in guayaquil , 280 km southwest of quito .
the draft constitution enshrines the power of the state over the economy , by reserving it the " development planning " of a country  |||  living  |||  mainly from the extraction of oil by foreign companies and the foreign money that they send to their emigrants .
buoyed by correa ,  |||  elected  |||  in 2006 , the project also provides greater powers to the head of state , which can carry up to two consecutive terms of four years and will be able to dissolve the assembly .
the constitution also consolidates the principle of  |||  free  |||  health services and education that the president has begun to establish in this country of 13.9 million inhabitants , where 50 % of the population lives below the poverty line .
it also foresees the prohibition of the presence of foreign troops , which will terminate the agreement between quito and washington for  |||  using  |||  ecuador as a launch base for u.s. antidrug operations .
an  |||  egyptian  |||  commando squad launched an assault against the kidnappers of the eleven tourists and their eight escorts captured ten days ago .
they are in  |||  cairo  |||  .
the eleven european tourists and their eight egyptian escorts  |||  held  |||  captive for ten days in the desert have been returned on monday afternoon unharmed to the egyptian capital .
in the morning , they were released by an  |||  egyptian  |||  commando in chad .
apparently fit , the hostages arrived around 1530 hours aboard a special plane at the  |||  military  |||  base of al-maza , attached to the international airport of cairo .
they were immediately transferred , without being able to  |||  speak  |||  to the press , via helicopter to the hospital in maadi , a residential suburb of cairo , to undergo examinations .
they are in " good health " , and " no ransom was  |||  paid  |||  " to the captors " , declared the egyptian minister for tourism , zoheir garanna , on the tarmac .
captured on september 19 during a safari in a 4x4 at the foot of mount ouanat at borders with egypt , sudan and libya , this group of hostages had been tossed around from one hideout to  |||  another  |||  by 35 unknown kidnappers .
an egyptian security official said that 30  |||  members  |||  of the special forces , carried aboard two helicopters , had launched the assault during the night just before dawn .
he said that 150 members of the egyptian special forces " rapid response " unit have been sent to sudan as a whole , where they received  |||  support  |||  from german and italian commandos .
the head of the italian diplomatic corps franco frattini in belgrade where he currently is , mentioned the role  |||  played  |||  by italian secret agents and elements of the special forces .
" we must recognize that we have achieved this  |||  result  |||  through the professionalism and effectiveness of our men from the secret services , from the special forces , " he said , without further details .
he also  |||  denied  |||  paying a ransom .
the day before , the sudanese army had claimed to have intercepted a 4x4 patrol vehicle on  |||  board  |||  of which were the captors , killing six , including the chadian head , and arresting two .
letters - the silent  |||  majority  |||  of culture
a  |||  debate  |||  on the financing of culture made the headlines and has engrossed this electoral campaign .
who will come forward to denounce the misery that is granted to small museums , archives , archaeological or  |||  national  |||  historical sites which are starving for funding ?
which politician dares to remind the federal  |||  government  |||  that it is neglecting its monuments and heritage buildings ?
in quebec , in canada , we have no real  |||  laws  |||  that effectively preserve our heritage ?
did you know that the  |||  french  |||  government devotes three and a half million euro just for the restoration of the castle of chinon in the loire valley ?
they often are the watchdogs of our heritage , who protest with the energy of despair when developers and constructors launch their bulldozers against our old buildings and our  |||  forgotten  |||  cemeteries .
when will there be a forum for  |||  history  |||  and heritage ?
fortis  |||  bank  |||  partially nationalized by benelux governments
benelux states help fortis , the belgian -  |||  dutch  |||  bank - which is the first european financial institute in trouble due to the follow - through effect of the american lending crisis - by a partial state buyout . the three countries have agreed to inject eur 11.2 billion into the banking and insurance company having hungarian interests .
at the end of this week , the belgian , the luxembourg and the  |||  dutch  |||  governments consulted on this issue at the highest level , involving the president of the european central bank and the competition commissioner of the european commission .
under the decision made on sunday night ,  |||  each  |||  government will take a 49 percent stake in fortis banks in their respective countries .
the bank will certainly sell some part of its stakes , especially the insurance activities , which it purchased from the  |||  dutch  |||  abn amro last year .
fortis shares started to plunge deeply last week , then in the second part of the week signs of a  |||  serious  |||  crisis appeared at the company .
the shares of the bank  |||  fell  |||  by 12 % on friday , which is the record lowest level for 14 years .
the value of the  |||  shares  |||  has been dropped by two thirds since january .
|||  considering  |||  the current stock prices , the entire market capital value of the group is around eur 14 billion . however , company directors say this does not reflect reality .
the management blames the uncertainties overseas - which are  |||  linked  |||  to accepting the american package of usd 700 billion - for the fall of fortis shares .
filip dierckx was appointed the new chief executive officer of the  |||  bank  |||  on friday .
the financial institute was also seeking private buyers but no substantive  |||  offer  |||  has been made so far .
no panic has emerged so far among the  |||  customers  |||  of the bank ; no bank rush has taken place .
fortis has an own banking establishment in hungary and has bought out leasing  |||  companies  |||  , too .
the  |||  american  |||  life and health insurance companies often refuse to sell insurance to some citizens , due to their drug purchase data .
data protection experts are afraid that the data market  |||  becomes  |||  uncontrollable .
" there is a data protection programme that requires the permission of the person  |||  concerned  |||  in order to use the drug prescription data .
it should be independent , otherwise the fox will be guarding the hen - house " , the washington post quotes richard dick , developer of the programme applicable for tracking  |||  drug  |||  prescriptions .
insurance companies decide on the insurance fee and the amount to be  |||  paid  |||  in case of damages depending on the health condition of the applying customer , and if they consider it too risky , they do not provide insurance .
dick developed a much cheaper method ten years ago : on the basis of the customer 's identification  |||  number  |||  the type of drugs purchased by the customer in the last 18 months can be easily detected , thus the programme can draw the consequences by its own regarding the illnesses the applicant suffers as well as their health condition .
for instance , the case of regularly buying big doses of cholesterol - reducing drugs practically refers to the fact that the customer has untreatably  |||  high  |||  blood fat level , as a result of which this person would immediately be put to a higher risk category .
the programme has various versions in trade , some of them even defines the risk factor , thus the insurance company has nothing else to do but the paperwork , though smaller  |||  difficulties  |||  arise .
one of the disadvantages is the fact that some  |||  drugs  |||  can be used for several purposes , for example some medical formula are to treat migraine , heat waves or even depression .
the latter one is a significant risk -  |||  increasing  |||  factor from the view of business insurers , while the other two are not .
they are already obliged to do so ,  |||  though  |||  their previous failures have not been penalized .
some companies process even the results of laboratory examinations and connect those to drug consumption data . this way they can  |||  provide  |||  more accurate information on the patients ' health condition .
more and more companies gain access to the data and , in parallel , the control of their use become increasingly  |||  difficult  |||  .
there is a  |||  specific  |||  act on health care data protection but its scope includes only health care providers and insurance companies .
the bill on providing inspection  |||  power  |||  for the authorities over companies dealing with data provision has been submitted to the congress .
|||  global  |||  marseille menu
|||  european  |||  union and india doubles trade
as the european union and india are  |||  leading  |||  trade partners of each other , the agenda of the ninth summit was also dominated by this issue in addition to other , mainly global , problems .
today a france - india summit is going to be  |||  held  |||  , too , particularly about nuclear power co - operation .
though the european union recognizes that india is an emerging democratic world - power , which should be  |||  granted  |||  more say in international affairs , the member states have not been able to come to an agreement yet whether to support the permanent membership of new delhi in un security council or not .
thus this  |||  matter  |||  was not forced during the ninth summit , organized in marseille yesterday .
french president nicolas sarkozy as rotating president of the union , committee president josé manuel barroso and foreign policy chief javier solana welcomed indian prime minister manmohan singh and  |||  agreed  |||  to double , i.e. increase to more than 100 billion euros , the trade flow in 5 years .
since  |||  exchange  |||  of goods raised from 25 billion to 55 billion between 2000 and 2007 , this is not an overly ambitious objective .
accordingly , 26 existing bilateral civil aviation conventions with india have been legally harmonized , meaning that air  |||  traffic  |||  can wing in the future .
india aims to sign the  |||  free  |||  trade agreement with the union until the end of 2009 .
sarkozy  |||  promised  |||  to accelerate harmonizing .
the summit concentrated on global  |||  issues  |||  :
on the situation in afghanistan and pakistan as well as on terrorism . the latter was condemned in  |||  every  |||  form by both parties and convening the un conference was urged .
the completion of doha trade round was also expedited ,  |||  although  |||  both parties are responsible for the fiasco so far .
india agreed with this as well as with the goal to reach a global agreement at the climate conference which is due  |||  next  |||  year and to decrease greenhouse gas emission by 50 percent until 2050 .
another goal was to  |||  prevent  |||  the growth of food prices and a call for an international conference to review financial crisis was supported .
the indian prime minister is going to a bilateral meeting in the french capital today , where he intends to come to an agreement on the  |||  peaceful  |||  use of nuclear power .
paris expects french companies to be awarded contracts to  |||  build  |||  nuclear reactors in india in a value of 20 billion euros .
according to  |||  news  |||  agency information , the agreement would be in force for 15 years .
over three hundred  |||  italian  |||  editors in frankfurt
more than three hundred will be the  |||  italian  |||  editors present at the sixtieth anniversary of buchmesse , the most important international event for the exchange of copyrights .
francesco maria giro , the undersecretary for cultural heritage and activities ministry will  |||  represent  |||  the italian government at the inauguration ceremony of the italian pavilion : in fact italy will be present as an institution with an italian stand -- 264 metres squared of exhibition space .
according to the data , there is a progressively diminishing importance of books by foreign authors in italian production , and in  |||  particular  |||  in that for adults and children .
found the aeroplane of steve fossett the millionaire  |||  disappeared  |||  a year ago
the wreckage has been found on a plateau at 3000 metres altitude , in the sierra nevada area of mammoth lakes , at the  |||  border  |||  between california and nevada .
the madera county sheriff , john anderson , has dispelled any remaining doubts : " the aeroplane has been located , we have  |||  sent  |||  a team , and now we have confirmation that it is the one on which steve follett was flying the day he disappeared " he said in a press conference .
afterwards , the sheriff pointed out that no human remains have been found either on the plane , nor in the  |||  surrounding  |||  area .
the millionaire , 63 years old , was given up for  |||  dead  |||  in february .
the american national transport safety bureau ( ntsb ) has reported that some hours after the wreck was spotted an investigatory team was  |||  sent  |||  , that has then identified the aircraft : it is the bellanca 8kcab , which has been missing since 3rd september 2007 , when fossett took off from yerington in nevada for a three hour flight .
the items are two documents in the name of fossett , both issued by the federal aviation  |||  administration  |||  of illinois , some cash , and a sweatshirt .
the millionaire had gained himself a place in  |||  history  |||  thanks to a series of world records .
in 2002 , at his sixth attempt , he became the first man to complete the round the world trip in a hot air balloon : a two - week solo  |||  flight  |||  .
|||  three  |||  years later he did the round the world trip by plane without landing .
among his many  |||  records  |||  , there is also flying at 15,445 metres , above the andes , but with a co - pilot .
glk , the  |||  advertising  |||  that does not await you
in  |||  short  |||  , this is glk , the latest addition to the " compact " off - road vehicles from the starred manufacturer , with which mercedes - benz has tried to let in a breath of fresh air into this sector .
|||  right  |||  because its features are out of the traditional norms , the message accompanying the launch of the glk suv will also be unexpected and unconventional , it will be available in mercedes - benz showrooms as from next october 17th .
so the publicity campaign that will accompany the debut of the new vehicle will set off a new communication  |||  method  |||  which also includes a futuristic campaign of 3d billboards , used for the first time in italy by a car brand .
a project of large billboards , set in motion in three  |||  different  |||  phases , which will dominate the most central milanese shopping street , corso como , until the 15th november .
in fact , looking at the  |||  image  |||  one will get the sensation that the car protrudes out of the poster .
subsequently , through the use of the innovative technology elumina 8 all the details of the new glk will be illuminated at various times , and then be recomposed as a  |||  single  |||  image .
without any doubts , mercedes , through this advertisement , is  |||  trying  |||  to introduce something new into the conventional field of automotive publicity .
will it succeed with this formula to provoke the  |||  interest  |||  of future buyers ? we will see .
here is who the  |||  italian  |||  hooligans are
but who are those 150-200 people of  |||  whom  |||  italy is now ashamed ? they form part of the group " ultras italia " who for years has been supporting the national football team and till now , truth be known , has never created major problems .
neither has it  |||  ever  |||  clashed with opposing fans .
from verona , padua ,  |||  trieste  |||  , and udine .
they take up their ideas from english  |||  fans  |||  .
the figc had put at the disposal of the italian fans 144 tickets for the  |||  match  |||  : all personal , hence easily checkable .
four italian supporters , who had  |||  previous  |||  stadium - related crimes , had in fact been refused tickets and kept from going .
now the ministry of the interior is waiting to be able to read the official records , which should arrive from the bulgarian police before taking steps : in this instance , it is possible to ban for five years at least the supporters that have been arrested or those that have been  |||  identified  |||  during the disturbances .
an international banishment which prohibits the attendance of not only stadiums in italy but also in all of  |||  europe  |||  .
" we have to immediately put out this conflagration and not legitimise those that behave in this  |||  fashion  |||  " , assert those at the ministry in viminale .
so , " eyes wide  |||  open  |||  especially since there is the national team playing on wednesday at lecce " .
tomorrow the observatory meets , on tuesday the casms which can count on a section of the aise , that is the  |||  secret  |||  service , which handles exactly the problems in stadiums .
" the chorus duce - duce and the arm stretched out during the mameli anthem ? in bulgaria it 's not a  |||  crime  |||  ... " .
these are the thoughts (  |||  expressed  |||  with great disappointment ) of domenico mazzilli , who , as of a few weeks ago , is the director of the observatory of the viminale ( he achieved the post which was initially held by francesco tagliente and then by felice ferlizzi ) .
it 's  |||  true  |||  , says mazzilli , that in bulgaria it is not a crime to chant hymns to the duce but certainly the behaviour of those 150-200 fans has been disgraceful .
" i am not a sociologist -  |||  adds  |||  the n. 1 of the observatory -- the crime should be imputed in the country where the incident occurs .
|||  food  |||  : where european inflation slipped up
the skyward zoom in  |||  food  |||  prices is the dominant force behind the speed up in eurozone inflation .
|||  official  |||  forecasts predicted just 3 percent , bloomberg said .
according to one analyst , ecb has been caught in a catch - 22 : it  |||  needs  |||  to " talk down " inflation , to keep from having to take action to push it down later in the game .
germany 's november inflation rate of 3.3 percent counts as a  |||  record  |||  ; in spain the rate shot up to 4.1 percent from an earlier 3.6 .
soaring  |||  food  |||  and energy prices sent eurozone inflation into the stratosphere .
consumers also have had to pay significantly more for vegetable oils and  |||  dairy  |||  products in 2007 .
the world market price of crude oil shot up by 52 percent this year , with the black gold costing nearly 100 dollars a barrel  |||  last  |||  month .
analysts see the 12 - month inflation rate as holding steady at about 3 percent over the next 3-4 months , but say that the annual average  |||  rate  |||  will be 2.1 percent .
they also predict that the ecb will cut  |||  interest  |||  rates twice during the course of 2008 .
fidesz support shot up significantly in  |||  early  |||  december after a lengthy period of just holding its own . this gives it the strongest support base it has seen since 2002 , while gallup reports support for the socialists at an all - time low of 13 percent .
the poll puts mdf and szdsz numbers below the threshold needed to get into parliament ; garnering about 2 percent  |||  support  |||  each within the entire sample .
for next year , over half the public expects things to get worse and only one in ten predicts an  |||  improvement  |||  .
thirteen percent of the sample said it trusted or highly trusted ferenc gyurcsány , while 38 percent put their trust in viktor  |||  orbán  |||  .
fifty - four percent said they did not trust the pm , while 27 percent said they mistrusted the fidesz  |||  chairman  |||  .
one gauge of the political situation is the proportion of people who  |||  believe  |||  that dissatisfaction with the prime minister can be managed without having to put a new government in office .
when queried about interest in a referendum , 60 percent of the sample said it definitely would vote in one , while  |||  another  |||  20 percent said it most likely would go to the polls .
74 percent of people want to repeal tuition fees , 79 percent to scrap co - payments for doctor visits and 84 percent want to end per diem  |||  hospital  |||  charges .
auchan prices are highest , tesco 's are up by  |||  almost  |||  20 percent
|||  article  |||  from napi gazdaság
prices in napi 's usual christmas basket were up by an average of 16 percent again this year in the budaörs shopping triangle , with  |||  each  |||  of the giant supermarkets pushing prices up by well over a thousand forints .
since supermarket prices went through the roof last december , the hikes did not look quite as drastic percentage - wise , when compared to that high  |||  base  |||  .
nonetheless , it has to be a shock to  |||  consumers  |||  to discover that they need over ten thousand forints to buy the same products they could get for well under nine thousand a year ago .
napi 's basket exceeded the psychological huf 10,000  |||  limit  |||  by a minimum of huf 91 at the giant supermarkets tested .
the most expensive basket  |||  cost  |||  us 10 573 forints .
the  |||  price  |||  of unicum and live fish stayed at roughly last year 's level , but boneless turkey breast , walnuts , and poppy seeds were up significantly .
we found the price of flour and bread to be mostly in line with official statistics office data ,  |||  though  |||  we discovered bread going for 139 forints a kilogram at auchan .
the competition factor was not enough to push the  |||  product  |||  's price down to under 200 forints .
another surprise in this  |||  store  |||  was that it charged less than 200 forints for a two - litre bottle of coca - cola in a bottle with a deposit on it , so the full price including deposit was still only 257 forints .
|||  nevertheless  |||  , this year napi 's basket cost the most at auchan and the least at cora .
we worked the numbers and found that napi 's basket cost 15 percent more than  |||  last  |||  christmas at cora , while it was 18 percent more expensive at both tesco and auchan .
in forints , the average  |||  increase  |||  was 1,480 .
and this was the factor that totally confused the commerce sector . the supermarkets were obviously  |||  unable  |||  to decide on the size of the price gap to apply to specific products , finding it impossible to calculate the effect the price increases would have on consumption .
( if the outlet makes a mistake in calculating the turnover velocity of a product , it stands to take a  |||  major  |||  hit on its profits with a price gap adjusted to turnover intensity . )
last year , with the vat hike the price  |||  increase  |||  in napi 's basket ran up against such extremes that the most expensive basket was 1,720 forints over the 2006 level , while the cheapest was only 844 forints more expensive .
( this is not quite in line with official statistics office data : its figures show price  |||  increases  |||  of over 30 percent in just 12 months for certain basic foodstuffs
including both flour and  |||  eggs  |||  . )
we found that most shoppers in the  |||  three  |||  outlets visited were not really interested in prices .
hospital cleanliness , overcrowding , and overburdened  |||  staff  |||  are not conducive to halting infections , said the division chief at the national centre for epidemiology .
many places even try cutting back on disinfectant use to  |||  save  |||  money .
an mrsa - an antibiotic resistant staphylococcus -  |||  infection  |||  was recently diagnosed in the traumatology ward of jános hospital .
the patient was  |||  isolated  |||  .
the same hospital had had to contend with a similar infection  |||  early  |||  this year .
it had discharged a patient admitted after a serious traffic accident . shortly afterward , it had to re - admit the patient because of an mrsa infection , and doctors have been unable to perform surgery that would be  |||  vital  |||  to full recovery because they have been unable to get rid of the staph .
this year , up to 10th of december , hospitals have reported 1,094 cases of infections  |||  caused  |||  by antibiotic - resistant pathogens to the national nosocomial surveillance system , said national centre for epidemiology physician - in - chief karolina böröcz .
one - third of all people carry the staphylococcus aureus ( sa ) bacteria in their noses without it ever  |||  causing  |||  an infection .
however , if antibiotics are overused or inappropriately used , the bacteria that originally responded well to antibiotics can evolve into an antibiotic - resistant variety , which spreads  |||  rapidly  |||  in hospitals if hygienic conditions are lax .
particularly at risk are elderly and low - body - weight patients whose immune systems have been temporarily or permanently compromised . among these patients , the staph can  |||  cause  |||  serious nosocomial infections such as wound infections or sepsis .
according to jános hospital 's  |||  medical  |||  director , there is nothing unusual about having an mrsa infection since they are part of everyday hospital life .
the  |||  vast  |||  majority of nosocomial mrsa - induced infections could be prevented said böröcz . however , she added that current hospital conditions are not conducive to preventing the evolvement and spread of antibiotic - resistant infections .
since this type of infection typically occurs in hospitals and nursing homes , hospitals should routinely  |||  check  |||  all newly admitted patients and immediately isolate mrsa carriers .
but , taking microbiological samples from patients is not fashionable in  |||  hungarian  |||  hospitals .
one reason is that the  |||  national  |||  health insurance fund does not cover the costs of these tests .
in most cases the bacteria remain unnoticed  |||  unless  |||  the patient has an obvious mrsa infection , said the national centre for epidemiology physician - in - chief .
the european union has stringent protocols on the  |||  appropriate  |||  use of antibiotics in human medicine and hungary has its own guidelines on treating various infections and pathologies .
the goal should be targeted therapy , meaning that microbiology tests should be  |||  conducted  |||  to prevent resistance from evolving , but hospitals do not always keep to this .
therefore , washing hands , and wearing gloves and masks play a  |||  significant  |||  role in prevention , but here again , we find many shortcomings in hospital practices .
in fact , hospital wards are often overcrowded , with beds too  |||  close  |||  to one another although they should be at least 1.5 metres apart to conform to epidemiological requirements .
sadly , we also find that when hospitals are short on funds they tend to  |||  save  |||  on disinfectants , said böröcz , adding that with a shortage of nursing staff and too many patients , chances of infection increase .
|||  government  |||  programme to combat mrsa
|||  treating  |||  mrsa infections costs the health insurer huge amounts of money , so efforts should be made everywhere to keep them from occurring in the first place .
in the uk for example , the government has a  |||  programme  |||  in place to cut back mrsa and prevent its spread .
the programme appears to be successful for  |||  published  |||  data shows that mrsa is on the decline in the uk.
the european centre for disease prevention and  |||  control  |||  ( ecdc ) has set prevention of the evolvement of multi - resistant pathogens ( including mrsa ) and of nosocomial infections as a priority project .
police chief  |||  causing  |||  fatal accident was not drunk
an official professional opinion has been submitted regarding a fatal accident  |||  caused  |||  by budapest 's district 22 police chief .
attila morvai , spokesman for the budapest municipal prosecutor 's office , issued a statement on friday , on receipt of the professional opinion . the opinion unequivocally concludes that the district 22 police chief , who has resigned , could not have been under the influence of alcohol or any other  |||  substance  |||  when he hit and fatally injured a pedestrian on tuesday .
the pedestrian  |||  died  |||  shortly after arrival at a hospital .
the district police chief resigned because of the accident and  |||  requested  |||  that he be retired from the force because , said a police communique , he was so shaken by the event .
the former  |||  police  |||  chief has been cooperating fully with the prosecutors investigating the case , morvai added .
|||  additional  |||  400 million euros available for infrastructure
four hundred million euros in loans will become available for education , transportation , the  |||  environmental  |||  infrastructure and energy development in the wake of three accords signed by finance minister jános veres and european investment bank ( eib ) vice - president marta gajecka , in budapest on friday .
eib approved a framework package of 300 million euros in 2006 to help the hungarian budget finance transportation and environmental projects being  |||  implemented  |||  by the cohesion fund . a concrete agreement for 100 million from the package was signed earlier , so one new contract covers use of the remaining 200 million euros .
the second agreement , for 150 million euros , will help the budget  |||  finance  |||  education - related projects .
the third agreement was for 50 million euros to be used for innovation . the central  |||  budget  |||  plans to incorporate it primarily into a r&d project at debrecen university .
they  |||  agreed  |||  that when hungary finalizes metro financing details with the eu , they would revisit the original contracts to see whether they needed to be amended , and if so , how .
veres said he believed that latter discussion would take place in the first  |||  quarter  |||  of 2008 .
eib has provided hungary with the equivalent of 8.4 billion euros  |||  since  |||  1990 , which were used to finance 113 projects .
eib is linking interest rates on the  |||  loans  |||  to the euribor . it is allowing an 8 year grace period , and is charging no commission to maintain fund availability .
the real estate market in bulgaria has been  |||  developing  |||  at an unbelievable rate - all of europe has its eyes on this heretofore rarely heard - of balkan nation .
who is  |||  buying  |||  what and where on this market , which is still the cheapest in the eu despite rapidly rising prices ?
this analysis comes from re / max 's  |||  bulgarian  |||  division .
no question but that bulgaria is the most sought - after east european real estate target , with its low - cost ski chalets and oceanfront  |||  homes  |||  .
according to re / max bulgaria analysts , sooner or later , the central portion of the country will begin attracting investors . so a growing number of people are already  |||  buying  |||  properties in veliko tarnovo , gabrovo , elena , tryavna - , and more and more investors are looking around the rousse area , which is expressly cheap at the moment .
sofia , the capital , also has many attractive opportunities . commercial and office  |||  space  |||  offers the highest returns .
forward - thinking investors are already making  |||  major  |||  purchases , for instance , in and around bansko .
analysts  |||  suggest  |||  that people who buy real estate in bulgaria would also like to change their lifestyles .
maltese and cypriot investors have also gained a foothold , while russians are traditional big - time buyers at the  |||  black  |||  sea and along top ski slopes .
there are three types of international  |||  buyers  |||  , said regional manager of re / max bulgaria georgi yankov .
the ones who plan to resettle in bulgaria either  |||  purchase  |||  renovated properties for prices ranging from 50,000 euros to 100,000 , or old fixer - uppers for 5,000-15,000 and then renovate them themselves .
they want their purchases to be easy to access , and to be equipped for modern communication . it is important that they be in a big city , with  |||  shopping  |||  and , generally , a local doctor nearby .
real estate prices in sofia , the capital , are rising steadily , as is  |||  demand  |||  .
while bulgaria boasts the european union 's lowest real estate prices , they have still gone up by 21 percent in the  |||  past  |||  five years .
environmin and hungary 's six  |||  percent  |||
|||  professionals  |||  and politicians from 192 countries are slated to discuss the bali roadmap that focuses on efforts to cut greenhouse gas emissions after 2012 , when the kyoto protocol expires .
the  |||  united  |||  states has let it be known that it is unwilling to negotiate precise numbers although it is not opposed to agreeing to a 25-40 percent cut in greenhouse gases by 2020 when compared to 1990 .
the other big question at the conference is whether the developed nations are ready not only to reduce their emissions but also to  |||  offer  |||  financial and technological assistance to countries that need it .
hungary 's six  |||  percent  |||
fodor  |||  noted  |||  that the eu has its sights on a 20 percent drop in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared to 1990 , whether the " post - 2012 agreement " is reached or not , and is ready to cut them by 30 percent if the other major developed regions of the globe and developing nations are also ready to accept obligations to the extent of their abilities and responsibilities .
hungary agreed to cut its greenhouse gas emissions by 6 percent compared to 1985-1987 , a goal it intends to  |||  meet  |||  , said the environment ministry 's press release .
the result could be a  |||  delay  |||  in emissions reduction , which would put earth on a certain course towards an average temperature rise exceeding 2 degrees celsius . should that happen , scientists say the consequences would be dire and irreversible .
uk uses youtube as military  |||  recruiting  |||  tool
british  |||  military  |||  units have been sharing their iraqi and afghanistani actions through video clips on you tube in an effort to popularize their missions .
the royal air  |||  force  |||  ( raf ) was the first to develop a taste for youtube : its special forces in afghanistan have been uploading video clips showing how they have been combating the taliban since march 2006 , bbc reports .
fully 139 raf images have been uploaded onto the  |||  internet  |||  and so far over they have received over 75,000 hits .
the uk defence ministry has been registered since spring 2007 as " defence headquarters " , regularly uploading video clips on iraqi and afghanistani  |||  actions  |||  , while the commonwealth office and the multinational force - iraq ( mnf - i ) have their own you tube channels .
the raf originally uploaded the videos as a recruitment tool . the defence ministry says they have also been a good way to let the public know the  |||  real  |||  purpose of keeping the forces abroad .
publicity disseminated through this avenue costs almost nothing when compared to traditional recruitment commercials on television , defence expert gordon mackenzie told bbc . at the same time , they inadvertently carry a bit of a political message for , in a special way , they offer insight into the reasons why the government ordered the ongoing military  |||  actions  |||  .
a problem the military has to contend with involves the amateur videos being shared alongside the carefully edited and censured official clips , which sometimes even show dying soldiers . in the slightly hypocritical " official " clips , officers will at most talk about their losses but the bloody side of the  |||  fighting  |||  is never actually shown .
quite a  |||  number  |||  of videos from the iraqi and afghanistani battlefields showing live action have been posted on the internet , but british forces have only recently joined in the postings .
american recruitment is a bit different . the us has been  |||  using  |||  america 's army , a tactical shooting game available for free download , as a recruiting tool . in it players become soldiers in a more - or - less realistic simulation of fighting forces .
other ministries plan parties with live bands , while still  |||  others  |||  are giving out raffle tickets and a glass or two of christmas spirits to enhance the mood and find a way into the hearts of staff .
celebrations , christmas spirit , concerts and smorgasbord - how the  |||  powerful  |||  party .
this year the defence ministry is planning the biggest ministry  |||  christmas  |||  party , but the guests wo n't be ministry staffers .
the national development agency ( nfü ) and the ministry of  |||  economics  |||  and transport ( gkm ) are kicking up their heels and partying more ardently than the other government offices .
gkm is holding its party at the house of the future , and spending huf 4,320,000 on the package for about 350 of its 600  |||  staff  |||  members .
nfü spent 4,700,000 forints on its christmas cheer , holding its celebration at the headquarters of the  |||  national  |||  justice administration council ( oit ) on wednesday . it is offering guests a series of concert performances and dinner .
the hall rental cost one million forints , and the rest  |||  went  |||  on the more than four hundred invited guests .
we have been told that one division within nfü has been  |||  invited  |||  to another christmas party , too : a bid management company , the hungarian economic development centre ( mag zrt ) , will be celebrating with eu money .
it rented out the entire vígszínház  |||  theatre  |||  for the event .
oit headquarters played host not only to nfü but also to the justice and law enforcement ministry , which decided to hold a lucia day ball on december 7 , instead of a  |||  christmas  |||  party .
about 500 people  |||  attended  |||  the ball .
the party got underway with a toast by the  |||  minister  |||  , and after the dinner there was dancing to live music .
when questioned [ by origo ] they said that formal dress was not  |||  mandatory  |||  for either women or men .
the ministries of health , labour and local  |||  government  |||  organized more puritan dances .
the health ministry ran a  |||  celebration  |||  for its staff at its own headquarters , spending 400,000 forints on the event .
local government minister gordon bajnai plans only to drink a  |||  simple  |||  toast with staff in the assembly hall of the ministry for local government and regional development .
the finance ministry ( pm ) is holding a christmas gathering in its own assembly hall and has invited 436  |||  staff  |||  members .
it plans to spend huf 2,500 per guest for the christmas party , which will  |||  include  |||  a smorgasbord buffet and one toast per person .
pm workers have welcomed christmas in this fashion  |||  every  |||  year since jános veres became minister .
people do n't actually plan to party - the mood will remain official , thanks partly to the  |||  minister  |||  who intends to make a speech , and partly to the timing - it will be in the afternoon .
the  |||  farm  |||  ministry is holding off for a new year 's reception , which will be on january 20 , so there wo n't be any christmas celebration .
its  |||  reception  |||  will be at a vajdahunyad castle in the city park , and the ministry reported that it plans to spend 1,000 forints per guest , for 100 guests .
the media department underlined that it was offering a very  |||  simple  |||  buffet meal , to which it was inviting only the professional diplomats accredited to hungary .
the reception , a repeat of one held annually for some time now , will again begin with a  |||  brief  |||  greeting from the minister and end with just a bit of snacking .
the environment ministry was  |||  unable  |||  to tell us the cost of its office christmas .
forces for a  |||  huge  |||  strike come together
on friday , the liga unions and the  |||  national  |||  federation of workers ' councils ( mosz ) will put together a strike committee charged with coordinating an open - ended strike set to start on monday .
they plan to hold a  |||  protest  |||  rally on saturday and on monday - the day parliament is scheduled to vote a health insurance bill into law - they will begin their work stoppage .
the strike is certain to snarl the transport network , for rail traffic will come to a more or less  |||  complete  |||  halt and budapest public transport will be frozen until 1.00 p.m. .
liga and the workers ' council federation will publicize details of their jointly  |||  organized  |||  monday walkout on friday afternoon .
organizers plan to hold a public protest demonstration on saturday , and the organizations joining the  |||  strike  |||  will begin an open - ended work stoppage on monday unless they can come to prior agreement with the government .
if by some chance parliament fails to adopt the health insurance law , the unions will immediately retract their strike  |||  appeal  |||  .
if they adopt the bill , the strike committees will meet and decide on their  |||  next  |||  moves .
given parliament 's agenda for monday , it is conceivable that the health insurance bill may not come up for a vote until evening or possibly not until  |||  late  |||  at night .
many unions and civic organizations have responded to the  |||  strike  |||  appeal . a complete and regularly updated list of them is available on liga 's website .
some organizations have announced open - ended strikes , while  |||  others  |||  are limiting themselves to temporary work stoppages .
the national federation of physicians will hold a nationwide strike over staggered hours while the democratic union of healthcare and  |||  welfare  |||  workers ( eddsz ) , a part of the umbrella union cooperation forum ( szef ) , plans a two - hour warning strike .
the most important of liga 's four demands is that the government repeal its health insurance reform bill and submit a new concept for society - wide  |||  debate  |||  .
the second  |||  demand  |||  is that the new method for calculating pensions due to begin next year be introduced gradually instead of all at once .
the third is that when determining the occupations eligible for  |||  early  |||  retirement , the jobs to be included in the option be chosen before 2010 .
political capital : the hungarian guard has heightened the country 's  |||  risk  |||  level
actions by the hungarian guard ,  |||  established  |||  in august with the support of the movement for a righter hungary , has raised the political risk level of hungary and the entire region from a number of aspects , according to the risk analysing division of political capital .
the research entity issued a " risk warning , " writing : the actions of the hungarian guard are triggering an exceeding political risk " that the already existing ethnic tensions between the gypsy and non - gypsy residents of hungary could heat up to toxic levels as  |||  early  |||  as the short - term , leading to ethnic conflicts that could turn violent . "
the major reason for this is that hungarian guard 's political strategy appears to be aimed at provoking  |||  action  |||  of this nature , the research institute added .
in addition , the research institute believes that the extensive domestic and international media attention to hungarian guard  |||  actions  |||  has " significantly damaged hungary 's international image , particularly as regards belief in the stability of the country and in the sophistication of its democracy . "
" the common feature of these groups is that they call themselves civic organizations while openly declaring that they are preparing their members for defensive - including armed - tasks ( citing disaster management , national  |||  defence  |||  , law enforcement ) while declaring that the police and armed forces , in other words , the government , is unsuited for the role , " political capital adds .
in other words , their emphasis on the civic nature of their actions and their choice of the association as their organizational form are not merely ruses to sidestep legal pitfalls to registration with the courts , but are also part of a  |||  political  |||  strategy .
according to the analysis , the activity of the hungarian guard is heightening the  |||  risk  |||  of damaging our relations with our neighbours , too .
all of these factors influence the  |||  political  |||  stability of the region , " it adds .
the research institute notes that the establishment of the hungarian guard is not a  |||  unique  |||  phenomenon in central and eastern europe , and as such it heightens the political risk for the whole of the region .
it notes that the operation of the hungarian guard is similar to that of the bulgarian national guard ,  |||  established  |||  in august 2007 by the far right bulgarian national union . ( bnu ) .
serious conflicts that broke out between roma and non - roma in a sofia district ( krasna polyana ) were behind the establishment of the  |||  bulgarian  |||  guard .
bnu took advantage of the disturbances to  |||  establish  |||  its guard , claiming that the goal of the organization was " national self - defence . "
the initiative triggered heated  |||  debate  |||  among the bulgarian public , it added .
one sign that the risk of ethnic conflict has  |||  increased  |||  , the analysts wrote , is that some roma organizations in bulgaria have announced plans to establish a guard of their own as a resistance force .
since the hungarian guard has so far acted quite similarly to the bulgarian  |||  national  |||  guard , it is quite possible that the roma community of hungary could respond to the threat by organizing their own self - defence , wrote political capital in warning of the risk .
political capital research manager attila juhász responded to a query from the mti hungarian wire service by saying that  |||  risk  |||  analysis was one of the research institute 's chief activities .
|||  each  |||  year , he said , they publish risk analyses , and if they discover any factor that might alter risks , they notify public opinion by publishing a risk warning , as they have now done .
hungarian law names the red - letter days specifically , and reorganizing working days to increase the number of days off around the holidays has become a  |||  general  |||  practice , although next year we will not see quite so much reorganization .
|||  holidays  |||  are not uniform in the eu or the usa either .
the hungarian legal system distinguishes among  |||  national  |||  holidays , state / bank holidays , and non - working days .
non - working days are for the most part religious holidays and anniversaries of  |||  significant  |||  historical events .
hungary celebrates new year 's eve and day : the  |||  final  |||  day of the old year and the first day of the new one are both non - working days - the latter if for no other reason , then to recover from new year 's eve festivities .
there are a  |||  total  |||  of eleven red - letter days in each calendar year .
march 15 is a  |||  national  |||  holiday commemorating the revolution of 1848 while october 23 commemorates the revolution of 1956 .
august 20 marks the founding of the  |||  nation  |||  , while may day is labour day . on november 1 and 2 we commemorate the dead , remembering our friends and relatives who have left us .
since our state , national or even religious holidays rarely fall on the weekend , it has become customary to reorganize the working week when there is only a  |||  single  |||  workday between the holiday and the weekend .
the long weekend comes with a price however , which is to have to spend the preceding or succeeding saturday at work or in  |||  school  |||  .
for many years , the  |||  minister  |||  of labour has issued decrees naming the days on which we have to work to get extra day off between the holiday and the weekend .
the decree covers all employers and all  |||  workers  |||  they employ , as well as civil servants and public employees .
it does not cover staff in facilities , businesses or institutions that regularly  |||  operate  |||  round - the - clock , and where staff works 24/7 .
|||  next  |||  year most holidays will come during mid - week , so where will be less manipulation of the calendar than this year .
the first re - organization of the  |||  working  |||  week will occur to accommodate may day and allow working people to have four consecutive days off .
|||  saturday  |||  , april 26 will be a workday , and in exchange , friday , may 2 will be a day off .
the working week will be turned about again around the  |||  october  |||  23 holiday . saturday , october 18 will be a workday so that people may have friday , october 24 off .
the end of the year , however , will be wall - to - wall holidays , with most people enjoying time off from december 24 through the new year , even  |||  though  |||  new year 's eve falls on a wednesday .
six little things you can annoy your  |||  colleagues  |||  with
the e-mails we forget to  |||  send  |||  , the voice - mail messages we never get , the white lies we tell and no longer even notice - they can all colour day - to - day life on the job .
the question is whether you get used to the minor annoyances or pick up the gauntlet and deliberately  |||  avoid  |||  dubious situations that can irritate others .
" oops , sorry . i forgot to tell you that  |||  marketing  |||  was looking for you , " says one of your colleagues .
in a best case scenario , he or she will apologize and try to mend things . he or she might even phone marketing to explain about the forgotten  |||  message  |||  ( this scenario is quite rare ) .
do you borrow  |||  things  |||  that do n't belong to you ?
nothing is more annoying than reaching for a document , piece of office equipment or  |||  telephone  |||  which turns out not to be there .
perhaps you see the pen you thought you  |||  lost  |||  lying on your colleague 's desk .
do n't take anything away from a colleague 's desk without asking . they have every  |||  right  |||  to be angry if you make off with their belongings .
do not pocket office envelopes or post - it notes . it can be very irritating if they run out prematurely , especially if you 're the one who  |||  needs  |||  one immediately .
do you gossip about your colleagues '  |||  private  |||  lives ?
there is no good way to  |||  halt  |||  gossip that has already begun to spread .
who is doing what with  |||  whom  |||  ?
if someone shares his or her most intimate secrets with you , do not abuse that  |||  trust  |||  !
keep what you  |||  hear  |||  to yourself . when a colleague is out , do not discuss his or her private life with others , even if they also know what the person has been up to .
if you know beforehand that you are not going to be in , or if something happens that forces you to stay  |||  home  |||  for a day , let your colleagues and supervisor know in advance . do n't surprise them by not showing up .
all of these things can be irritating , even if people are not concentrating on a project (  |||  writing  |||  , planning or organizing something ) at that very moment .
do you blame  |||  others  |||  for your mistakes ?
if something is n't ready by deadline , if you forgot to  |||  send  |||  out an important letter or pass on a message , do not blame others for your forgetfulness !
is the office too much like a second  |||  home  |||  ?
track suit and slippers : quite comfortable when you 're at  |||  home  |||  , but they are not office wear !
do not dress for  |||  leisure  |||  at the office , even if your job allows it !
do not be sloppy . show respect for your  |||  colleagues  |||  and yourself by dressing tastefully - and elegantly if your job requires it - to go to work .
i 'm creeping along in the car in the  |||  usual  |||  morning traffic jam .
the radio starts playing an unusual tune : it 's a violin  |||  sound  |||  with special electronic effects .
the music changes beat and a base tone joins the other instruments . then , like a  |||  true  |||  jewel , a female choir steps in .
the domestic music world has n't spoiled us with  |||  high quality  |||  electronic pop in a long time .
but now , all of a sudden you can  |||  look  |||  at the traffic jam in a new light while listening to the new zagar cd .
the appearance of yonderboi and the few new and exciting productions that have popped up from the domestic digital underground are slowly changing the overall picture . although guitar - pinging garage rock is  |||  back  |||  in style , domestic electropop is ready to prove that there is something new under the sun.
his project ( zagar ) and his  |||  music  |||  , an alloy of jazz , electronic dance music , and pop began pushing upward into the public ear when he was suddenly asked to compose soundtracks for films ( such as
the group  |||  responded  |||  with a new and even better cd .
we would be on course with the easygoing reference to flight but for the effects of the louder guitar and the rock and roll beat that joins the soaring tones , homage to the spirit of the  |||  times  |||  .
györgy ligeti , who sings in britain with the  |||  puzzle  |||  , made his intro with these tunes , when the disc was premiered at the millenáris .
so ,  |||  everything  |||  's okay . or is it ?
hvg . hu : the question this new hit song raises is just how culty your music has  |||  remained  |||  ?
i think there are two light music castes ; not mainstream and underground and not alternative and pop , but commerce and  |||  honest  |||  .
so - called alternative or underground music can be dull and uninspiring and produced for the  |||  sole  |||  purpose of boosting sales , which puts it in the commerce category .
while a good pop song can be sparked by  |||  honest  |||  motives .
the attitudes of the recipients  |||  operate  |||  in that spirit , irrespectively of language and national boundaries .
hvg . hu : do you see any difference in the receptivity of domestic and international audiences as far as your  |||  music  |||  goes ?
b. zs . :  |||  light  |||  music has more tradition abroad , especially west of here .
over there , older people also come to  |||  concerts  |||  , not just teens and twenty - somethings .
they pay far more attention to changes in the genre because they  |||  consider  |||  it a part of contemporary culture .
hvg . hu : what role does the  |||  audience  |||  play in your work ?
b. zs . : of course it  |||  feels  |||  good to see more and more people at our concerts .
but we have never designed our  |||  music  |||  for the market .
the role of the audience comes out at the concerts when the effects are contagious , but even that comes from the intangible changes triggered by the  |||  moment  |||  .
i have actually noticed that the  |||  moment  |||  you decide that you want to meet audience expectations , you cease to be interesting .
hvg . hu : to what extent do you plan to  |||  follow  |||  yonderboi 's example ?
he 's a soloist and has  |||  built  |||  a career west of where we are .
in the beginning there was no way to avoid having our music compared to yonderboi since several of us split from that group , though we chose a  |||  different  |||  road .
many folks first heard the  |||  name  |||  zagar with this number .
b. zs . : we never  |||  planned  |||  to have a hit to boost cd sales .
we  |||  intended  |||  it to wrap up the album , to try to lighten up the orgy of tone and the tougher themes earlier in the cd .
why did you pick the voices you did - what was your guiding  |||  principle  |||  ?
that gave us the six - voice choir - of sena , edina kutzora , judie jay , bori péterfy , enikő hodosi [ neo ] , and juci németh - ,  |||  whom  |||  we simply named underground divas .
b. zs . : we had had an instrumental version of it for quite some time . but then , when we were putting the cd together , we got the feeling that we  |||  needed  |||  to add something .
i remember being totally excited by it at the time , but the divas really were  |||  necessary  |||  to make it work .
hvg . hu : the girls  |||  appeared  |||  to be secondary , on both the disc and at the concert .
there is no solo ( excepting judy jay 's tiny one ) , they have no  |||  separate  |||  role , they sing completely in unison and they do n't outsing the music , so it 's not as though they were singing to subordinate musical accompaniment .
on stage , they stood at the  |||  back  |||  .
b. zs . : the reason why they stood at the back of the stage was because of  |||  technical  |||  problems .
the whole number was about forgetting our egos for a time , not caring who came from where and where they are headed , and simply letting those wings , the wings of  |||  love  |||  , lift us up .
for instance dorian gray 's dilemma , where i play on a concert piano , or rock'n'roll goes to the girls , where the groove did n't want to work for the longest time - but  |||  everything  |||  eventually ended up fitting , kind of like a jigsaw puzzle .
at the moment it 's prophet is a fool ,  |||  escape  |||  from the earth , and never the same .
deceiving broker ventured  |||  billions  |||  due to inferiority complex
this is how the  |||  french  |||  banking giant société générale , the owner of the local komerční banka ( commerce bank ) , labels its ex - employee jerome kerviel .
on his  |||  account  |||  it has lost almost five billion euro .
more likely , it seems that kerviel was just a big gambler who wanted to  |||  match  |||  his colleagues , and , moreover , definitely not an unqualified one .
unlike all the big banking houses , he recognized the crisis at the  |||  american  |||  mortgage market in time .
" he is psychologically  |||  weak  |||  , " were the words of his superiors , who directed the police to him .
but , as follows from kerviel 's testimony , which has been published by french  |||  media  |||  , e.g. the le monde journal , he was a man who gained 1.6 billion euro from his transactions by the end of last year .
" all i ever  |||  wanted  |||  was to gain some money for my bank , " he claims in his testimony .
in the summer he managed to gain a half billion euro from this  |||  american  |||  crisis .
he had found the  |||  opportunity  |||  at the beginning of the year .
the news appeared in february that the so - called sub -  |||  prime  |||  mortgage loans , provided to low - income clients or to those who had problems with paying them off in the past , are going to have problems .
nevertheless , the crisis should not have  |||  influenced  |||  the entire economy .
by the end of the year , his  |||  profit  |||  had climbed to 1.6 billion euro .
he  |||  managed  |||  to deceive his superiors , even though the eurex exchange became interested in his affairs .
|||  rather  |||  not .
" i  |||  thought  |||  that the simple fact of my gaining 1.6 billion for the bank would satisfy them .
where did he get the will to  |||  risk  |||  that much ?
he entered société générale in the 2000 ,  |||  immediately  |||  after he had finished his university studies in lyon .
two years later , he was already an assistant to the broker , and in 2005 he became an  |||  independent  |||  broker with an annual income of $ 90,000 .
still he knew he would never earn as much as the  |||  others  |||  .
" as early as  |||  during  |||  my first interview in 2005 , i knew they despised me .
because of my education , and also for my professional and personal development , " kerviel  |||  described  |||  the situation to the investigators .
but soon after kerviel entered his career , the first big  |||  success  |||  followed .
thanks to the allianz shares he gained ; during the london bombings he bet a half billion euro that they would  |||  fall  |||  .
and that was the trigger mechanism - he  |||  wanted  |||  more .
but his superiors are said to have  |||  known  |||  , or rather suspected the whole thing .
but then , at the beginning of the year , a blow  |||  came  |||  .
in a  |||  single  |||  day , he lost 1 billion euro .
he  |||  wanted  |||  to expunge the whole thing after the weekend in the middle of january .
when he  |||  came  |||  to the office on monday , he was no longer employed by the bank .
and a few days later , the  |||  bank  |||  announced it had lost 5 billion euro because of him .
" i took only four days out of the  |||  last  |||  year .
czech republic has  |||  chance  |||  to get 365 billion .
the ministers of the czech government , together with the representatives of the european union ,  |||  signed  |||  nine operational programs yesterday , from which the czech republic can acquire 14 billion euro ( approximately 365 billion czech crowns ) in the following years .
this is roughly half the  |||  total  |||  sum the czech republic can acquire from brussels during the years 2007 to 2013 .
approximately 125 billion czech crowns will move from seven  |||  operational  |||  programs into the regions .
czech companies will be able to  |||  gain  |||  about 100 billion czech crowns from the enterprise and innovation program .
most of the money , up to 150 billion , will be directed into  |||  transportation  |||  .
the transportation program is the biggest  |||  operational  |||  program , it represents almost 22 percent of the resources which the czech republic can obtain from the funds .
this money will  |||  increase  |||  the budget of the state fund for transportation infrastructure , which will be managing a sum of 90.8 billion czech crowns next year .
the enterprise and innovation program ought to serve the entrepreneurs and companies to gain the resources for innovation  |||  business  |||  .
companies should obtain financial resources for the introduction of new technologies , for the  |||  industrial  |||  research , but also for the introduction of more effective methods of organization .
as for the actual extraction of money from the eu funds , the czech republic is thus far among the least successful within the newly  |||  accepted  |||  countries .
a 20 - year sentence for the ex - president of nicaragua has been upheld by the  |||  court  |||  .
the nicaraguan court of  |||  appeal  |||  upheld the 20 - year sentence for the ex - president of the country , arnoldo alemán , in which he was convicted in 2003 for financial fraud of up to $ 100 million ( almost 1.8 billion czech crowns ) on thursday .
however , he was later liberated and was under  |||  house  |||  arrest at his hacienda , not far from the nicaraguan metropolis .
according to the chairperson of the court of  |||  appeal  |||  , ileana péréz , it will now be dependent on the custodial officials , whether they will let aléman serve his sentence at home , or if he will go to prison .
the court  |||  proved  |||  four years ago that aléman had regularly shifted government money to the accounts of foreign companies in panama .
these  |||  companies  |||  were imaginary and the accounts were actually held by his relatives and closest adherents .
some of the money ended up in a fund which aléman  |||  established  |||  to finance his election campaigns in 2001 .
so they 've  |||  approved  |||  our budget
the state budget has been  |||  accepted  |||  .
the one for this year was  |||  passed  |||  last year still with the support of the czech social democratic party ( cssd ) , because it was prepared by minister sobotka and cssd could not afford for it to not be accepted .
in contrast to the animated  |||  debate  |||  before the vote of no - confidence in the government , nothing extreme has occurred this time .
it is a sort of  |||  paradox  |||  .
|||  each  |||  governance begins and ends with the individual chapters and items of the budget , like it or not .
the budget is a  |||  substantial  |||  part of politics , but it is covered by the struggle for power between the government and the opposition .
it is more widely appreciated by the media , that is why the  |||  media  |||  pay much more attention to it .
the politicians ' quarrels are much more interesting for the  |||  public  |||  than straight numbers .
the  |||  state  |||  budgets of the past social democratic governments suffered from three maladies which 2008 's budget is not able to resolve all at once :
first , there is the high portion of the expenditures mandatory by law , the so - called mandatory expenditures , including not only pensions , but also social benefits  |||  passed  |||  last year before the elections by the silent " alliance " of cssd and the communist party of bohemia and moravia ( kscm ) .
|||  second  |||  , there is the deficit economy as a result of the first malady .
the third  |||  limit  |||  is the deficits in public financing , i.e. the budget deficit of cities and villages .
however , the state budget deficit is not the biggest  |||  risk  |||  .
it is public and relatively under  |||  control  |||  .
the time  |||  bomb  |||  here is the deficit of the budgets of cities and villages .
in the past years , they  |||  managed  |||  to pay the debts off by the mass sale of stocks of the power and distribution networks they acquired from the state during privatization .
they no longer have this  |||  resource  |||  .
if we stick just to the  |||  official  |||  and certifiable facts , we discover that :
our economy has already been passing through the phase of growth for a few years , as is the  |||  rest  |||  of the world , about which cssd keeps boasting .
this has been a unique opportunity for its governments to put public financing in  |||  order  |||  .
other  |||  countries  |||  , with a few exceptions such as hungary , albania , pakistan or egypt , have managed the money much more reasonably than our republic .
it is a  |||  huge  |||  shame , which falls mainly upon the previous governments .
we are among the countries which are , measured  |||  globally  |||  , endangered by poverty to the least extent .
therefore there is no need for any  |||  massive  |||  social programs , which have unfortunately been inflated to a huge extent in the past years .
with a bit of exaggeration , we can say that the governing politicians will  |||  become  |||  white - collar workers mechanically distributing most of the taxed money between pensions and social benefits .
the  |||  planned  |||  deficit of 70 billion for 2008 would be totally useless if the past governments had not lost as much as they could during the last ten years .
if we do not want to let the governing politicians become mere white - collar workers , we have to be patient and allow the not very strong coalition government , which is  |||  aware  |||  of the fact that the state can give over only as much as it can obtain on taxes and charges , peace for the preparation of other reform laws .
only they will allow for a gradual achievement of a balanced  |||  state  |||  budget .
banks want to  |||  solve  |||  crisis
the  |||  american  |||  federal reserve bank , the european central bank and the central banks of great britain , switzerland and canada have decided to fight against the crisis on financial markets together .
in public sales , banks bid on the interest rate for which they are willing to  |||  borrow  |||  money .
for example , the american fed will  |||  send  |||  $ 40 billion into public sale and make 24 more available to the european and swiss central banks .
it is the first time after the september 11 attacks that the central banks of the individual states settled on such a coordinated procedure aimed at preventing or decreasing the  |||  effects  |||  of a financial crisis .
" this step should solve the biggest economic problems , i.e. the growing lack of  |||  free  |||  capital banks can lend , " wrote bernard baumohl from the counselling company economic outlook group in the report for his clients .
" the coordinated action of the central banks  |||  reduced  |||  the probability of the recession in the u.s. from 65 percent to about 50 percent , " added baumohl in the report .
banks have already  |||  lost  |||  $ 60 billion due to the non - repaid loans , especially in the u.s.
the analysts  |||  expect  |||  further billion - dollar losses .
" the central banks must be very afraid of what more can  |||  follow  |||  , if they decided in favour of such a procedure , " said the main economist of abn amro , kieran davies .
" it  |||  seems  |||  that the situation is really bad , " he added .
the central banks worry that if the banks themselves have a  |||  difficult  |||  access to loans , they will also lend to their customers for more .
that will lower the consumption and send the american economics into a recession , with possible impact on the  |||  economic  |||  growth of the whole world .
the central banks made this decision after the failure to lower the so - called libor  |||  rate  |||  , a london interbank rate , which is used for lending money on a wholesale market .
this meant that the banks still feared mutual money lending , even though the central banks of the u.s. , canada and great britain  |||  reduced  |||  their interest rates several times during the autumn .
" it will have the same  |||  effect  |||  as another decrease in the interest rates , " greg salvaggio from tempus consulting told reuters .
klaus : environmentalists '  |||  debates  |||  are unbelievable
global climate changes will mostly harm  |||  developing  |||  countries .
president václav klaus has again commented on the problem of  |||  global  |||  warming .
in vienna , where he presented his book " a blue , not a green planet " , he said that the environmentalists '  |||  debates  |||  were unbelievable .
according to mr. klaus , it is not only the structure of the conference , which consists of a strange mixture of government officials and nongovernmental organizations which cannot be accepted , but also the fundamental difference between the rhetoric which accompanies it and the  |||  reality  |||  .
" the  |||  debate  |||  there is absolutely unstructured , it is just a burst of words which are a substitute for the resolution of current problems , " said mr. klaus .
the czech president emphasized during the presentation of his book that its topic is very  |||  important  |||  for him , which is why he is so engaged in it .
he also expressed his satisfaction with the fact that his book is also available in  |||  german  |||  translation , because , as he said , " i frequently encounter only caricatures of my opinions " .
so now everybody interested can  |||  read  |||  his undistorted attitudes .
mr. klaus  |||  mentioned  |||  that although he is no environmentalist , in his opinion he has enough qualifications to write such a book .
that is , he is an academic , able to observe and evaluate technical discourse , he is  |||  experienced  |||  in statistics and he is also an economist .
as the main conclusions of the book , he designated the theses that climates change constantly and their changes are thus normal , that there is no consistent opinion of all the researchers on global warming , that the effects of the  |||  current  |||  changes are not too great and relevant and so they do not represent any threat and that the efforts to influence the evolution of the climate are useless , inefficient and unacceptably costly .
moreover , as a man of experience with totalitarianism , he considers forcing unsubstantiated opinions on  |||  others  |||  , which he feels as a dangerous restraint of freedom , to be unacceptable .
mr. klaus had talked on the same subject two months ago at the hayek institute in  |||  vienna  |||  .
six hundred thousand drivers missed the  |||  deadline  |||  and did not manage to renew their old driver 's licenses , the validity of which will expire at the end of the year .
however , the ministry is not afraid that hundreds of thousands of drivers would set out on the  |||  road  |||  without a valid license after new year 's eve .
according to the authorities , it is mostly those who do not want to  |||  drive  |||  anymore who did not renew the license .
while villages report a  |||  sharp  |||  decline in interest in driver 's license renewal , the authorities in the city are overloaded with applications and the interest in the license renewal has grown this week .
they spend about half an hour  |||  waiting  |||  in line .
the issue of a new license  |||  takes  |||  twenty days .
in that case , the  |||  driver  |||  pays five hundred crowns extra .
motorists who do not manage the renewal of the license before the end of the year and set on the road without a valid driver 's license will be threatened with a  |||  fine  |||  .
a person who breaks the law will pay a  |||  maximum  |||  of two thousand crowns .
in case of an administrative offence , the  |||  fine  |||  will climb to 2,500 crowns .
according to earlier information the council could even  |||  fine  |||  someone who does not drive at all .
according to him , a driver 's license is a document which the people should be allowed to  |||  decide  |||  whether they want or not .
it is not an identity  |||  card  |||  which everybody must keep validated .
it is sufficient to take it to the competent municipal office or  |||  send  |||  it by registered post .
by the end of the year , the validity of the licenses  |||  issued  |||  during 1964-1993 will have expired .
people with driver 's licenses from 1994-2000 have  |||  three  |||  more years for the renewal .
the validity of the licenses issued 2001-2004 will end in  |||  december  |||  2013 .
according to hanzelka , this concerns roughly 2.6 million other  |||  documents  |||  .
|||  court  |||  reduces sentences for detectives affiliated with berdych
ex - police officers josef opava and petr koňařík , who are accused of  |||  criminal  |||  conspiracy with the david berdych gang , will go to prison for thirteen and ten years , respectively .
it was decided definitively by the high court in prague , which thus  |||  reduced  |||  their sentences by one and two years , respectively .
it is not possible to  |||  appeal  |||  today 's decision , only an appeal to the supreme court is possible .
|||  though  |||  berdych is charged in this case as well , he is still waiting for the verdict in the first instance .
nevertheless , he has already been given sentences in other  |||  trials  |||  totalling more than 16 years .
in january , the regional  |||  court  |||  found 19 people guilty , above all of the participation in felonies , the high court was dissolving the appeals of 16 of them today .
most of those charged refuted the indictment from the beginning of the investigation , claiming that it is a fabricated  |||  case  |||  .
in exchange , the  |||  gang  |||  surrendered 30 percent of the loot to opava and koňařík .
the indictment deals with the  |||  crimes  |||  of the gang from 1999-2001 .
namely , these were thefts whose victims often suffered  |||  serious  |||  physical injuries , but also the abuse of power and possession of illegal weapons .
according to the indictment , the gang made tens of  |||  millions  |||  of crowns in the thefts .
except for the nearly twenty men in this  |||  trial  |||  , the courts have lawfully convicted berdych and a number of other people of other thefts .
other men surrounding berdych are still testifying in front of the court in a  |||  different  |||  trial , but some of the cases have not come to the trial yet .
the trial has thus far avoided tomáš půta and maroš šulej , currently in an irish jail , where they await the decision  |||  regarding  |||  their version to the czech republic for prosecution .
an account of the baby switch : 12  |||  million  |||
the lawyer for the aggrieved families , igor veleba , is requesting 12 million czech crowns in  |||  compensation  |||  for the switch of the babies in a maternity clinic in the třebíč hospital , plus legal expenses .
three million for each of the mothers , two for each father and a million for each  |||  child  |||  .
the hospital is offering a maximum of 200,000 for  |||  each  |||  of the parents .
the  |||  hospital  |||  's attorney , ondřej dostál , therefore radically disapproves of veleba 's proposition .
" we reject such a claim , it is too high , " dostál said after today 's  |||  meeting  |||  .
we will find out if it has any informative  |||  value  |||  at all .
still , we stick to our opinion that it is going to be in hundreds of thousands for all , " dostál  |||  stressed  |||  .
at the beginning of the case , the jabloňov family demanded a million crowns for  |||  each  |||  month they were not with their biological daughter .
according to the advisors in the field of psychology and psychiatry , the parents of the children have suffered  |||  psychological  |||  injury and stress of various degrees and intensity .
the stressful situation was  |||  better  |||  endured by the men , though they struggled with remorse that they did not prevent the switch of the newborn babies .
on the other hand , the women are coping worse with the urgency of the trauma experienced and of what is happening  |||  right  |||  now , veleba summed up .
veronika and nikola were switched by the  |||  nurses  |||  in the třebíč maternity clinic on december 9 of the last year .
|||  last  |||  week , the children returned to their biological parents - nikola to the čermáks to přibyslavice and veronika to libor brož and jaroslava trojanová to jabloňov .
vysočina county supervisor miloš vystrčil gave 100,000 czk to  |||  each  |||  of the families as compensation for the expenditures that ensued from the mistake by the třebíč hospital , run by the county .
all hospitals in the  |||  czech republic  |||  are insured for the liability for damages by law .
by now the courts have awarded relatively low  |||  compensation  |||  to people , with the sums calculated according to the tables in six digit numbers , exceptionally in seven digit numbers , in czech crowns .
" the quarrel consists in the fact that mr. harabiš and his team sponge off of bolek polívka 's popularity , " said polívka 's lawyer after the  |||  trial  |||  .
mr. harabiš is of the same  |||  opinion  |||  .
" after some years , they realized that the project was  |||  successful  |||  and that he could profit from it .
they want to sponge off of our  |||  labour  |||  , " he added .
a lucrative  |||  business  |||
in 1993 , he was crowned by the  |||  actor  |||  radoslav brzobohatý .
nevertheless , at the time it was not related to the intention to build a fictitious  |||  kingdom  |||  .
several years later , mr. harabiš came up with the  |||  idea  |||  of issuing wallachian passports .
from an originally prank act , a  |||  business  |||  and a lucrative enterprise have evolved , which harabiš then extended by establishing the company " wallachian kingdom " .
in 1997 , polívka  |||  agreed  |||  with the use of his name and signature in the passports and even offered discounts on visits to his farm and theatre performances to their holders .
who will ascend to the  |||  throne  |||  ?
the judge also  |||  mentioned  |||  today that harabiš only used the bare idea which polívka made public in the circus for his business plan .
" the popularity of boleslav polívka certainly  |||  helped  |||  the wallachian kingdom project , " said the judge .
but she added that the heart of the project was harabiš and his  |||  team  |||  , which has devoted itself to it so intensely .
the collaboration of currently quarrelling parties  |||  continued  |||  until the year 2000 , when harabiš organized an official coronation in vsetín for polívka .
from then on , quarrels begin to accumulate between polívka and harabiš , which culminated in the dethronement of " the king boleslav i  |||  elected  |||  forever and ever " .
on the instigation of harabiš , the  |||  leading  |||  role in the kingdom was then taken over by the singer jarmila šuláková as the queen mother .
in 2002 polívka brought a lawsuit against harabiš and his company , which the  |||  court  |||  overruled today .
he did not want to disclose any  |||  details  |||  or the schedule yet .
it should be  |||  something  |||  like the king 's ride in the slovácko region .
the king should be  |||  elected  |||  for a definite time span .
even mr. polívka can sign up , "  |||  added  |||  harabiš .
the test of peugeot 207 sw 1.6 vti : melting  |||  prejudices  |||
to tell the truth , i have  |||  never  |||  rooted for peugeot 206 too much .
its handling characteristics have not been  |||  anything  |||  special , the quality of gear control , driving control and construction could occasionally have been labelled as mediocre .
but now there is its successor , the peugeot 207 on the market , and it is far  |||  better  |||  .
and the station wagon called sw  |||  goes  |||  even a step further and i cannot help but to give it another thought .
when i was testing the classical peugeot 207 hatchback , i complained for example about the headroom in the  |||  back  |||  seat .
i would  |||  appreciate  |||  some more designer inventiveness here , as the car itself looks so elegant .
the seats are comfortable and the times when we could have complained about  |||  short  |||  seats or seat backs are truly behind us .
also , the lateral seat support has improved markedly in comparison with the 206  |||  model  |||  .
considering the space , we can  |||  feel  |||  the build - up in the car body dimensions as well .
in the station , then , the already  |||  mentioned  |||  lack of headroom disappears .
i must evaluate it as very well  |||  accessible  |||  ( thanks also to the hinged quarter window ) and fairly spacious .
the blind spots are equipped with retaining elastics , which are an ideal  |||  compromise  |||  .
but not in comparison with the best selling car of this  |||  class  |||  in bohemia - the skoda fabia station wagon .
if we  |||  compare  |||  the 207 sw to the new generation of mladá boleslav products , we will see that the peugeot lags highly noticeable 52 litres behind .
for vacations in foreign countries or with a baby - carriage load , this number is almost  |||  critical  |||  .
120 horses in  |||  four  |||  rows
and to tell the truth , this is how a 1600 which powers a family hatchback should  |||  look  |||  .
it is  |||  quiet  |||  , it has low expenditure , and above all it really moves .
nevertheless , we shall bear in mind that we have tested a fairly  |||  equipped  |||  car with a spacious interior and a very good engine .
the basic  |||  price  |||  of the car with a 1.6 petrol engine of 329,900 czech crowns is not that bad .
but besides , we had the head airbags , the automatic air - condition , the automatic screen - wiper activation , the electric rear - window  |||  control  |||  ...
the car simply  |||  costs  |||  531,900 czech crowns all in all .
integration of slovak pupils in  |||  british  |||  schools not progressing
|||  british  |||  schools register even cases when quarrels between the immigrants and the children of the original population turn into violence .
the problem with the integration of children from eastern europe in  |||  british  |||  schools is exemplified well by the situation in northern kent , where quarrels between local residents and slovak immigrants are beginning to escalate .
arguments , bullying and fights between the  |||  pupils  |||  have extended to the relations between their parents .
the police also had to intervene following an attack by two teenage girls on a  |||  slovak  |||  immigrant .
the girls reportedly called the man racist  |||  comments  |||  and threw stones at him .
" when we were on our way  |||  home  |||  , a boy climbed onto the bus stop and started to spit down onto us .
when i asked him to stop it , he pelted us with apples and pears and than he showed up his nude bottom , " a mother of slovak pupils  |||  described  |||  another unpleasant accident for the times .
the complaints come from both  |||  sides  |||  .
one of the local residents even classified the quarrels with eastern european immigrants as a  |||  fight  |||  for survival .
the above  |||  mentioned  |||  cases indicate that the mood between the locals and the immigrants at british schools is beginning to be strained .
there are 70 thousand slovaks  |||  registered  |||  in britain who moved there for work .
roughly 30 thousand slovak pupils , then , attend  |||  british  |||  schools .
|||  cuba  |||  the most beautiful island of the caribbean
for its  |||  visitors  |||  it is really an island of freedom .
golden and lily - white beaches ,  |||  high  |||  waves or a sea calm as a pond .
kite - surfing , golf and  |||  roulette  |||  .
you will find a  |||  full  |||  and even richer list of all this on the islands in the caribbean sea .
but there is just one  |||  island  |||  where you find much more , and that island is cuba , the biggest and most beautiful of the west indies .
under the reign of spaniards , cuba was the stronghold of their  |||  american  |||  conquest .
and then the american era  |||  came  |||  .
its building was initiated by one of the bosses of the american mafia , lucky luciano , because all that was illegal in the u.s. ( especially during the prohibition ) was welcome and  |||  supported  |||  in cuba , drugs , gambling , prostitution .
among his  |||  guests  |||  were , among others ,
winston churchill , ava gardner ,  |||  frank  |||  sinatra .
ernest hemingway bought a homestead in san  |||  francisco  |||  de paula , not far from havana , and he had a yacht in cojímar .
even you can  |||  leave  |||  your autograph on the walls in the havana bodeguita .
and the cult cars from the 1950s have been driving around havana ever since , because the once  |||  imported  |||  zhiguli and fiat vehicles have decayed in the salty and damp weather .
though havana , particularly its oldest  |||  part  |||  , is significantly squalid , nowhere else in the surroundings is there such a great number of fabulous colonial sights .
other  |||  places  |||  have also been transformed into beauty , e.g. trinidad .
with respect to the fact that tourism brings in badly  |||  needed  |||  money , its development has the green light .
cuba offers one more rarity which is  |||  unique  |||  in the world , of special value to train lovers .
their wagon stock has not been renewed for dozens of years and so you can see functional trains there  |||  whose  |||  contemporaries elsewhere are now only in museums .
most visitors to  |||  cuba  |||  will not miss the best known spots .
and so there is no need to get into much detail about varadero or  |||  havana  |||  .
the viňales valley the viňales valley in the western part of the  |||  island  |||  is one of the most picturesque spots in cuba .
mogotes , limestone round - topped mountains and rocks rise up steeply from the  |||  bottom  |||  of the valley and fertile soil has taken hold in the cavities , thanks to which even the dilapidated rocks are covered with thick overgrowth .
you can encounter its  |||  final  |||  shape if you visit one of the havana factories for cigar making .
an ancient city which was  |||  established  |||  shortly after the spaniards had colonized the island .
fame and fortune were  |||  brought  |||  there with the slave and sugar trades .
the colonial spanish architecture , deeply influenced by the later  |||  french  |||  colonists , has not changed much during four centuries .
trinidad , between the sea and the escambray mountain range , is a place so remote that even as late as in the 1950s there was still no  |||  road  |||  to connect the area to the rest of the country .
the isolation  |||  helped  |||  it remain apart from it .
if you have more time for trinidad than just one afternoon , other interesting places in the neighbourhood are  |||  worth  |||  seeing as well , like the playa ancón beach or the sugarmill valley .
in the evening , it is appropriate go to casa de la música , which becomes full of life at nightfall and the  |||  music  |||  abates there at dawn .
a tiny  |||  town  |||  easternmost end of cuba is described by some as the most beautiful one on the island .
this opinion is certainly influenced by the  |||  road  |||  leading there itself .
both roads  |||  leading  |||  there from guantanámo must pass through high and rugged mountains and they go through natural surroundings nearly untouched by human activity .
thanks to its inviolate nature , the eastern cape of  |||  cuba  |||  has been placed by unesco onto the world heritage list .
they make the best chocolate there , they have a columbus  |||  cross  |||  in a church ( which was actually created about one hundred years after columbus 's voyage ) and from the hill where the former castle and what today is the hotel el castillo stands , you can see several mesas , of which el yunque is the most famous .
you can fill many pages writing about it all : the coffee , rum , cigars , the sierra maestra mountain range , the bay of pigs and the isla de pinos , the tropicana cabaret , the shrine of the patron saint of cuba caridad del cobre , santería , and  |||  african  |||  religions , which are professed by the descendants of former slaves .
allies in afghanistan  |||  passive  |||  , americans say
according to the u.s. , the low number of soldiers and the lack of  |||  necessary  |||  equipment is influencing the course of the mission in afghanistan .
in addition to the  |||  growing  |||  reluctance of the taliban movement , eight participant states will also discuss other plans and the coordination of the allies today .
whereas the u.s. ordered the nato units through the secretary of defense robert gates to increase activity this week , great britain sees the priority in the reinforcement of the afghan government  |||  authority  |||  and the intensification of developmental aid .
" the  |||  development  |||  in afghanistan is tangible , but armed forces can only be part of the solution .
ninety  |||  percent  |||
according to data from the u.s. army , the activity of the afghan  |||  rebels  |||  is the greatest in the last five years .
the nato countries have about 40 thousand soldiers in afghanistan , about a  |||  quarter  |||  of whom are in the southern territory .
but according to the u.s. , the allies have reached the very  |||  limit  |||  in the organization and equipment of the units .
they are specifically asking for additional helicopters , soldiers and experts on afghan unit  |||  training  |||  .
the secretary  |||  general  |||  of nato jaap de hoop spoke today with a similar intent .
" i am not happy about what we have on the  |||  ground  |||  and in the air in afghanistan .
we have about ninety percent of the soldiers and equipment we need , and that is  |||  little  |||  , " de hoop told reuters at the end of three - day talks with the japanese government in tokyo .
who is  |||  passive  |||
there are some quarrels among the countries  |||  involved  |||  over whether all the allies are doing their best in afghanistan .
for example ,  |||  germany  |||  has been criticized for passivity .
" germans have rather a  |||  numerous  |||  representation in afghanistan .
yet they are stationed in areas of minimum violence and the  |||  combat  |||  requirements on them are not as high as those on us in the southern and eastern parts of the country , " said gates .
the british tabloid the sun labelled  |||  german  |||  soldiers as lazy this week .
" the afghan layabouts disclosed : germans play as our boys fight , " wrote the sun in material accompanied by photos of german soldiers playing  |||  table  |||  tennis .
|||  national  |||  debt to vault to a trillion in 2009
there is  |||  national  |||  debt of more than 84 000 crowns for each czech .
the total  |||  debt  |||  rose by the end of september to 842.7 billion crowns .
the government  |||  planned  |||  to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year .
but at the beginning of december the ministry cut the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to the improved development of use of the  |||  state  |||  budget .
the czech republic 's  |||  national  |||  debt rose by the end of september to 842.7 billion crowns .
it has  |||  risen  |||  by 40.2 billion crowns in the nine months of this year .
|||  though  |||  it has fallen by 13.4 billion crowns since june .
this is the way in which the ministry of finance confirmed its data on the  |||  national  |||  debt from the beginning of october today .
during all of  |||  last  |||  year , the state incurred debts of more than 111 billion crowns .
" for now it appears that thanks to the lower deficit for the  |||  next  |||  year , we should not break the trillion crown limit until 2009 .
next finance analyst vladimír pikora sees it in a  |||  similar  |||  way : " we can get over the trillion limit in the course of the year 2009 .
the exact date will depend on the  |||  next  |||  budget , which we do not know yet .
if the situation in the political arena were to  |||  change  |||  , the politicians would be willing to spare more , it could be postponed to 2010 .
but we do not predict such a  |||  change  |||  , " he said .
|||  debts  |||  are growing
the national debt consists of the debts of the central government and emerges above all due to the accumulation of  |||  state  |||  budget deficits .
the national debt is  |||  financed  |||  by treasury notes , government bonds , direct loans or for example by loans from the european investment bank .
the  |||  state  |||  's internal debt has risen 38.5 billion to 719.4 billion crowns this year .
the foreign  |||  debt  |||  of the state has risen 1.7 billion crowns to 123.3 billion crowns this year .
the so - called marketable national debt  |||  reached  |||  803.3 billion crowns by the end of september and has fallen 13.7 billion crowns since june .
the average due date of the national debt  |||  rose  |||  to 6.5 years .
it is bad that the debt is  |||  growing  |||  , but on the other hand it shows that we will have something to trade when the pension reform comes , " pikora commented on the data .
better than  |||  expected  |||
it follows from the strategy of national debt financing and control for 2007 that the government  |||  planned  |||  to borrow 159.2 billion crowns this year .
but at the beginning of december , the ministry decreased the plan to 152.8 billion crowns due to  |||  improved  |||  development of the use of the state budget .
the sum consists mainly of the state budget deficit , which will probably  |||  reach  |||  76 billion crowns instead of the assumed 91.3 billion crowns this year .
it also includes the  |||  planned  |||  maximal resources of 13.3 billion crowns for the czech consolidation agency , a ten billion reserve for pension pay - outs , financing of government bonds for 43 billion crowns and the instalment payment of the loans from the european investment bank totalling 1.8 billion crowns .
she was liable to lashes  |||  punishment  |||  .
this 54 - year - old english teacher , who was working at the unity high school of khartoum in sudan , has been arrested last sunday at her  |||  home  |||  , with the accuse both of threatening islam and sedition , according to the article no. 125 of the sudanese criminal code , following many complaints of the children 's parents to the sudan 's ministry of education .
in fact , the case goes back to the month of september , when the school teacher asked her pupils , aged between 6 and 7 , to  |||  choose  |||  a name for the class teddy bear .
surely , muhammad is the name of the  |||  muslim  |||  prophet , but first of all it 's a very common name in sudan .
the bear  |||  itself  |||  did n't wear any label with that name , but the problem lies in the prophet 's representation , considered as an offence to islam .
a muslim colleague of gillian gibbons , who 's a teacher in the same  |||  school  |||  in sudan , has highlighted that he knew her well and that she would have never done anything offensive for any faith , " i 'm just sorry she has asked her pupils to vote for a name " , according to him , it 's simply an " innocent mistake " .
it 's an opinion  |||  shared  |||  with many of the teacher 's pupils , who describe her as " very attentive towards her pupils " and " a person who never talks about religion within the class " .
moreover , it should be reminded that muhammad is the second most common name in great britain , which is written in english in 14  |||  different  |||  ways .
this name , which is often chosen by  |||  muslim  |||  families , is one way of honouring the prophet ( it is often given to the family 's firstborn ) .
for instance , is it  |||  possible  |||  to give it to a toy ?
|||  certainly  |||  , it 's a matter of interpretation .
they have n't reached any accord on the province 's  |||  future  |||  statute on wednesday , during the last negotiations ' session in vienna .
serbians and kosovo 's albanians completed on wednesday morning in baden , in austria , the sixth and  |||  last  |||  session of negotiations without managing in overcoming their differences on the future statute of the separatist province .
" it is regrettable that the parties have n't been able to reach an accord on the statute " ,  |||  declared  |||  the european mediator wolfgang ischinger , during a press conference in vienna .
emphasizing that the peace in the region was " at stake " , his american counterpart , frank wisner , urged belgrade and pristina to respect their commitments to preserve peace and dialogue  |||  beyond  |||  the end of the negotiations .
troika mediators , which gathers the  |||  european  |||  union , usa and russia , will go for the last time to serbia and kosovo on monday .
the future of the province populated 90 % by albanian -  |||  speaking  |||  people will probably be clearer when ischinger , wisner and the russian mediator alexander botsane - khartchenko will have submitted their report to the un security council , by the 10th december .
baden 's discussions , near vienna , were the sixth and last  |||  negotiating  |||  session since the troika was charged with a new mediation by the united nations , last august .
americans and  |||  europeans  |||  consider that their mediation will end on the 10th december .
|||  unilateral  |||  declaration of independence ?
after eight years of united nations administration in kosovo , westerners believed that independence under supervision of the eu is the only  |||  viable  |||  solution .
pristina is ready to proclaim it unilaterally if the security council wo n't be in its  |||  favour  |||  .
|||  belgrade  |||  is insisting on an increased autonomy .
hashim thaci , the ex - commander of kosovo rebels and future prime minister of the province , expressed its  |||  regret  |||  .
but he added that the autonomy plan  |||  presented  |||  by belgrade " belonged to a past which led to murders and deportations " .
" domino  |||  effect  |||  "
the serbian president boris tadic suggested that a compromise was still possible , warning the kosovo  |||  albanian  |||  majority against the consequences of a unilateral proclamation of independence for the province .
belgrade fears a " domino  |||  effect  |||  " in a fragile region , weakened by the independence wars of the 1990s .
" for serbia , he said , this does not mean that a compromise is  |||  impossible  |||  . "
on tuesday , the serbian delegation insisted that  |||  every  |||  decision should be up to the security council , where its russian ally has a veto .
" kosovo 's parliament will have the last  |||  word  |||  "
" there 's just one acceptable solution for serbia within the security council " ,  |||  declared  |||  the serbian prime minister , vojislav kostunica .
" they should end as they began : within the  |||  security  |||  council . "
fatmir sedjiu answered the journalists that " kosovo 's parliament will have the last word on the statute " , adding that every unilateral declaration of independence coming from albanian -  |||  speaking  |||  people would be done by consulting the westerners .
bush snatches an  |||  agreement  |||  between israelis and palestinians
the president george bush  |||  announced  |||  , at the opening of the international peace conference convened by him on tuesday in annapolis , in maryland , that israelis and palestinians had finally reached their accord on a common declaration .
he stated that the israeli prime minister ehud olmert and the palestinian president mahmoud abbas  |||  agreed  |||  to begin immediate negotiations for finding a final settlement of the 60 - year - old contention between their two people .
in the presence of the two men , bush has promised to do everything to  |||  help  |||  them concluding a " peace treaty " before the end of 2008 .
in the meantime , palestinians have to demolish " terrorist infrastructures " and israel has to stop its settlement activities , declared bush , reminding both parties their obligations towards the peace " roadmap " they 've  |||  accepted  |||  in 2003 .
the head of the white house emphasized that the negotiations between israel and the palestinian authority chaired by abbas would aim at " the conclusion of a peace treaty solving every outstanding issue , without any exception , central issues  |||  included  |||  " .
at his  |||  turn  |||  to speak , olmert committed himself to future " direct and continuous " negotiations and to make an effort to end them in 2008 .
bush set at the end of 2008 the deadline for  |||  implementing  |||  his " vision of two coexisting states " of israel and palestine .
charged by all arabic countries , arabia , whose participation in annapolis is a success for washington , is at the origin of a plan which proposes peace to israel in exchange for its own territories occupied during the 1967 's war , east - jerusalem  |||  included  |||  .
annapolis marks " a crossroad in the middle - east history , particularly because it faces the conflict 's roots and its  |||  central  |||  aspects " , prince saud says in his interview with an arabic newspaper .
according to the prosecutor , the police is not  |||  responsible  |||  .
what did  |||  precisely  |||  happen on sunday ?
as always  |||  happens  |||  in this kind of situations , official versions and rumours are the opposite .
what are the circumstances of the  |||  accident  |||  ?
according to the first elements of the inquiry run by the  |||  general  |||  ispection of the national police ( ignp ) , a police car was moving around on sunday , shortly after 5 pm , louise - michel street , in villiers - le - bel .
" there was no emergency , they were on patrol and the car was circulating at 40-50 km / h , without flashing lights " ,  |||  explained  |||  a policeman .
" it struck the  |||  police  |||  car on the left , failing to give way to its right " , stated a policeman .
the results of the alcohol test were  |||  negative  |||  on the motorbike occupants .
very quickly , yesterday morning , the pontoise republic prosecutor , marie - thérère de givry ,  |||  announced  |||  she had entrusted an investigation to the ignp for " manslaughter and non - assistance to people in danger " .
in the afternoon , on the occasion of a press conference , the prosecutor states that the inquiry of the igpn , at this  |||  stage  |||  , discarded the police 's responsibility .
according to the prosecutor , three witnesses of the accident , questioned on sunday evening , confirmed " the police 's version , that is the mini - motorbike arrived quite quickly on their  |||  left  |||  " .
yesterday , some kind of groove , maybe  |||  caused  |||  by the toeclip 's rubbing , showed that the two vehicles got stuck until the car braked .
an autopsy on the two victims'bodies was  |||  conducted  |||  yesterday .
what did  |||  happen  |||  immediately after ?
according to that  |||  point  |||  , the ignp , remaining cautious , would reject " any serious mistake " .
" it 's one of the most  |||  difficult  |||  aspects of the inquiry , which requires more investigations , towards which it 's necessary to be very cautious " , stated a policeman .
one of his  |||  window  |||  looked precisely onto the scene .
" we got off immediately , me and my cousin who is a nurse at the hospital ,  |||  trying  |||  to revive them , explicates the witness .
then , he saw " a policeman  |||  completely  |||  shocked , limping .
two other people tried to revive them , a fourth person was  |||  talking  |||  on the phone " .
always according to this witness , the emergency service arrived " about twenty minutes after the police  |||  departure  |||  " .
" i wo n't let anyone say that the  |||  police  |||  did n't help them .
|||  everything  |||  has been done trying to help them . " , emphasized in her turn the prosecutor .

nowadays , more than one pregnancy out of three ( 36 % ) is still unplanned , reveals a survey conducted by the  |||  national  |||  institute of demographic studies ( ined ) , forty years after the neuwirth law , which legalized the contraception in france , was voted .
|||  different  |||  contraceptives , such as the pill or the coil , have a failure rate which is still between 5 % and 6 % , estimated the ined .
in spite of that , the legalization of the contraception leaded to a better " fertility control " , explicates the institute according to which the  |||  rate  |||  of the pill 's use among women between 20 and 44 years old has nowadays risen to 60 % , against 5 % in 1970 .
finally , nowadays eight births out of ten would be well  |||  planned  |||  .

the astronaut scott parazynski and his crewmates of the interntional space station ( iss ) spent more than seven hours  |||  working  |||  in space , repairing a mangled solar array , indispensable to continue the scientific activities of the station .
but it is necessary to provide them with  |||  electricity  |||  .
in order to produce electricity , then , the second task of the crew was to  |||  move  |||  a 17,5 tons module for solar arrays , which was already in the iss .
after having moved the module , the crew  |||  started  |||  using its solar arrays , which have a wingspan of 76 meters .
in order to avoid  |||  further  |||  damages , the array was stopped from bending .
and scott parazynski was  |||  chosen  |||  for the stitching , on the end of the 58 - foot robot arm that was added up for the repair .
he is one of the  |||  best  |||  nasa spacewalker .

the  |||  status  |||  quo choice
there wo n't be any suspense at sunday exit poll : russians are opting overwhelmingly for the party of the president putin ,  |||  united  |||  russia .
yesterday , welcoming the foreign ambassadors , the president did not betray anything , bringing just a further charge against the west , accused of interference - his favourite  |||  subject  |||  during the campaign .
the communist  |||  leader  |||  guennadi ziouganov says that " there has never been so dirty elections , even in eltsin times " .
after the repression of the last week - end demonstrations , it 's still forbidden to visit the ex world champion of flop , garry kasparov , sentenced to five days ' imprisonment for  |||  illegal  |||  demonstration , said his lawyer .
" russians saved the homo sovieticus  |||  mentality  |||  . "
- who will be putin 's  |||  successor  |||  ?
the official journal  |||  published  |||  yesterday the date of the first round of the elections , on the 2nd march 2008 ; the candidates have time until the 23rd december to come forward .
|||  elected  |||  for the first time in 2000 and for a second time in 2004 , vladimir putin can not afford a third mandate .
- which role is putin  |||  going  |||  to play after march ?
|||  prime minister  |||  ?
whatever the case may be , at the legislative  |||  elections  |||  , as well as at the presidential ones , the outgoing party will triumph .
it is a  |||  tradition  |||  .
" russians saved the homo sovieticus mentality , they do not feel the owners of their destiny " , considers the sociologist lev goudkov , director of the levada  |||  independent  |||  centre .
nikolaï kopossov , a historian of the st. petersburg state  |||  university  |||  , goes farther : the civil society in this christianized country was five centuries late than in europe ; the well - known community attitude postponed the birth of individualism .
russians are " voluntarily renouncing the personal responsibility " that they had briefly  |||  shown  |||  after the collapse of the urss .
the phenomenon affects every social class , business  |||  included  |||  .
and the administrative elite aims to  |||  keep  |||  the status quo : 65 governors ( out of 85 leaders of russian regions ) are heading the local lists of united russia .
the new freedoms imported from the  |||  west  |||  are often synonym of chaos , as it happened in the 1990s .
the public  |||  opinion  |||  prefers the stability .
it is the reason for which russians wo n't vote for  |||  extremists  |||  .
those who are in  |||  power  |||  are not so bad , why changing them ? "
the eleven states charged with their administration - among them germany , france , israel and the united states -  |||  agreed  |||  on may 2006 in making them available for research workers and historians .
completed the ratification process of the  |||  agreement  |||  , the archives are available since yesterday .
|||  sensitive  |||  information
up to now , many countries , among which germany , opposed the public availability of these private documents , because of the sensitive  |||  nature  |||  of certain information .
like the  |||  homosexuality  |||  or the mental handicap of some victims of the deportation .
nowadays , in bad arolsen , more than 300  |||  permanent  |||  employees still receive tens of thousands individual requests .
however , for some people of the scientific community , the access to bad arolsen has a  |||  limited  |||  interest .
" there is nothing new to learn from these documents " , declared in 2006 the pr wolfgang benz , director of the research centre on anti - semitism at the technische universität of  |||  berlin  |||  .

ump and nc  |||  refuse  |||  to examine ps 's proposals on the purchasing power
ump and nouveau centre groups refused on thursday to  |||  discuss  |||  some sections of the socialist bill on the purchasing power , that means they refused the text .

since ump and nc voted against those sections of the bill ( 180 against 115 votes ) , the meeting closed at the end of an often heated argument between majority and  |||  opposition  |||  , a few hours after the television speech of nicolas sarkozy on the purchasing power .

a new  |||  festival  |||  is coming
following many rumours on the creation of a new music festival in philadelphia by c 3 presents , this promoter / producer announces the vineland music festival in new jersey , in partnership with festival republic , organized by the  |||  british  |||  producer melvin benn .
" for our company , it 's an honour to collaborate with someone who has even inspired the  |||  current  |||  festival movement in america " , confessed charlie jones of c 3 to billboard.com .
vineland , in new jersey , is a summer  |||  destination  |||  for camping .
the festival is expected to be in a private  |||  farm  |||  of 500 acres about 40 minutes far from philadelphia and to last from the 8th to the 10th august .
formerly  |||  known  |||  as mean fiddler , the director of the festival republic , melvin benn , is one of the most respected festivals ' producer in the world .
in 1989 he organized the uk reading festival , which attracts  |||  every year  |||  about 80 000 people .
from 2002 , as a co - owner , melvin benn has been charged of the  |||  production  |||  , the licences concession and the organization 's tasks of the glastonbury festival , which nowadays can even host 177 500 people .
considering glastonbury " the most inspiring event " he has ever attended to , charlie jones of c 3 says that his company and melvin benn 's one are  |||  working  |||  side by side for giving the region a festival / event in european style .
" we chose philadelphia as our business and we 're hardly  |||  working  |||  with the fairmount parks commission for creating a festival in the centre of philadelphia " , states charlie jones .
" we were negotiating with the  |||  city  |||  and the commission was enthusiastic about our proposal .
unfortunately , we 've got bogged down in political issues because of the  |||  current  |||  administration , adds charlie jones .
" fortunately , we could  |||  talk  |||  to melvin benn and we 're going to create a wonderful festival in an extraordinary place which will be useful for philadelphia 's population . "
both festivals take place in an  |||  urban  |||  area .
" the european model of melvin benn is a country festival , while  |||  ours  |||  take place in open urban spaces " , says charlie jones .
vineland is more or less half way between philadelphia and atlantic  |||  city  |||  .
" vineland 's community , its mayor  |||  included  |||  , supports with enthusiasm this event " , says charlie jones .
he refuses to reveal the conditions of the agreement , but he states " that they will allow to invest in such a great event and host a festival which , we  |||  hope  |||  , will last for a long time . "
he explains that , although the invitations have been extended to the groups , nothing could be  |||  confirmed  |||  yet .
his partners of c 3 , which  |||  received  |||  the top independent promoter prize at the last billboard touring awards , are charlie walker and charles attal .
montréal  |||  faces  |||  terminator
it is not  |||  easy  |||  for montréal to attract hollywood movies when the rejector is terminator ...
a politically difficult task because the governor of  |||  california  |||  , arnold schwarzenegger , denounces the " runaway productions " .
is it  |||  difficult  |||  to play the role of the " governor " ?
" you need to be  |||  careful  |||  , it 's the industry which decides where to go .
if it finds  |||  favourable  |||  conditions in montréal , it will go there .
our role , is to  |||  offer  |||  the best conditions " , he says .
the  |||  festivals  |||  race
currently , denis turcotte 's priority is to  |||  promote  |||  our cinema .
all festivals of the west coast , taking place in sundance , denver , seattle or san francisco , will have to  |||  present  |||  quebec films , give prominence to them and make sure to fix a meeting with all directors .
it will be introduced at the palm springs  |||  international  |||  festival in january .
quebec has also  |||  presented  |||  four feature films and four short films at the american film institute fest this month .
will there be a year - end rally in the stock market ? the experts are  |||  divided  |||  by the ' subprime ' crisis .
nevertheless , this year the  |||  experts  |||  do not clearly know if this will happen .
banif thinks that " from a statistical point of view , december usually has a positive effect on the  |||  stock market  |||  .
nevertheless , it 's not opportune to make forecasts  |||  based  |||  exclusively on statistics , even more so in the present context , where uncertainties are visible in the markets , at least in the short term " .
although they are n't in favour of a stock - market run in the last weeks of the year , the experts point to " the stock market , which is maintained by liquidity , arranged to invest given the lack of alternatives with guarantees , especially the fixed rent , affected by the fled - effect towards quality shares as much in the long term as in the  |||  short  |||  one " .
for that , they think that stock - market will have a rather lateral behaviour , non -  |||  free  |||  of volatility " so we do n't know the impact of the fed 's probability reduction types , for the high level of crude oil and the stimulating danger of the inflationary tensions " .
javier barrio ,  |||  sales  |||  manager of bpi in spain , agrees that it is not a good time to take risks , thinking that there will be a rally .
" it is not a pleasing thing " , assures the  |||  expert  |||  .
ibex has lost nearly 4 % from the maximum reached on november 8th , when the index closed at 15945.7  |||  points  |||  .
even so , not all the  |||  experts  |||  share this negative viewpoint .
juan solana , intermoney analyst , believes that ibex 35 could  |||  close  |||  the year nearer to 16000 points thanks to portfolio reconstruction and the traditional contributions to the pension plans that take place every year on these dates .
on the other hand , federico olucha , inversis bank analyst , thinks that we are near to technical levels and " therefore , as far as the consequences of the crisis on the  |||  credit  |||  market , we could see a rebound in the index that could be impelled depending on the news arriving from the u.s.a. " .
the analyst trusts that this will be  |||  positive  |||  .
the analysts agree to  |||  choose  |||  the shares that will be the ones in charge for taking ithebex towards new maximum levels .
solana , of intermoney , affirms that " this year it 's the  |||  turn  |||  for the great stocks " .
the  |||  expert  |||  would include in the portfolio both : great banks and some constructors " because when the date arrives , the electrical sector will be very expensive " .
while , federico olucha , of inversis bank assures that the ascents will come from the banking and  |||  industrial  |||  sector .
" acs takes several months recuperating , and we hope that other construction companies like ferrovial and fcc go the same way " , explains the  |||  expert  |||  .
the consumer 's cycle will be the protagonist in the last part of the year due to the  |||  increase  |||  in the sales figures during the christmas sales season .
on the other hand , the  |||  expert  |||  thinks that the technological sales also will do very well although in this case there is not much presence in the spanish market .
five times in seven  |||  years  |||
in the  |||  last  |||  seven years , only on two occasions december has been a bearish month .
popular will  |||  open  |||  its 200 offices for 12 hours daily from monday to saturday
|||  popular  |||  has decided to renew a large part of their offices .
in total 200 ,  |||  located  |||  in the most commercial zones of spain .
these branches will operate under the mark  |||  popular  |||  max and represent a big change for the bank .
this is also true for the rest of the spanish banks , since this is the first group to decide to bet on an all - day aperture for their offices , until 20.30 in the evening , and  |||  open  |||  on saturdays from 1000 to 2030 hours .
another group that has also reiterated in several occasions that it wanted to extend the opening times of its branches , bbva , has not yet decided to make the  |||  move  |||  .
while , it 's near to closing an agreement with the unions who insist on the closure of 75 % of its offices on saturdays in  |||  exchange  |||  for opening late , although not to the public .
results from  |||  popular  |||  's experience will be decisive for other banks to follow the initiative , depending on commercial hours .
indeed this is the objective that  |||  popular  |||  is chasing with this project .
to catch the particular clients that circulate in these zones to make their purchases , to smes , the independent and commercial sales of the  |||  chosen  |||  streets to open .
the bank needs to have these 200 offices  |||  open  |||  in all spain within 18 months , since they are not building new offices but remodelling existing ones .
for that , the organization will modernize the branches that it already has in commercial zones , adapting them to the clients profile of the  |||  different  |||  streets .
in this way , the extension of the opening times is accompanied by a  |||  different  |||  space concept of the branch and a new design with more luminous colours .
the manager of the commercial bank angel creek assures that this reconstruction does not require a great  |||  investment  |||  , although an increase in personnel is required since one needs to go from about six employees at the premises to eight or nine .
the offices , that will even have meeting rooms for  |||  smes  |||  , will not sell financial products .
one positive  |||  experience  |||  for the group .
|||  popular  |||  has tested its initiative on three offices in madrid .
and it has been a positive  |||  experience  |||  , according to ángel rivero 's explanation .
branches of bravo murillo , o'donnell and gran via streets of madrid have been  |||  chosen  |||  , and it seems with success according to rivero .
and another 60 operate through the mundocredit trademark , specifically for immigrants , which have increased opening times , and even  |||  open  |||  on sundays and holidays .
in these popularmax  |||  offices  |||  they do n't replicate the bbva model , where several of their offices count on a great variety of non financial products for their commerce .
" we do n't want to  |||  compete  |||  with our clients " , says rivero .
at present , they have  |||  agreed  |||  with telefonica to sell cell phones , with personnel outside the bank .
for the first time telecinco doubles its  |||  stock market  |||  value when compared to its rival antenna 3
that  |||  gain  |||  puts the loss we suffered for the year at 15,66 % .
it 's rival , antenna 3 , that yielded 1.52 % and which yesterday accumulated a slope of 40.5 % from january , is valued at  |||  half  |||  that , 2,193.46 million .
shares of other quoted communication  |||  companies  |||  rise ; to 3,571 million in the case of sogecable , 2518.53 million for prisa ( publisher of five days ) and 1.779 million for vocento .
according to vasile , " we are  |||  speaking  |||  of two similar companies " and hence the comparison with antenna 3 .
" the  |||  fact  |||  is how much are we able to operate within the same market , at what cost , and how we can profit in terms of customers " .
if the published data is true , the television network has registered this year an  |||  increase  |||  of 3,6 % in publicity revenue with respect to the 965.4 million of the 2006 exercise .
on the other hand , the net revenue of antenna 3  |||  increased  |||  by 1.6 % in the first nine months of the exercise ( reaching 734.4 million ) whereas the net income of the television grew by 0.7 % ( 630,4 million ) .
vasile assures that , although it is too soon to make a decision , this ratio may  |||  change  |||  after purchasing 33 % of endemol in partnership with its parent company mediaset .
" officially , we are  |||  committed  |||  to pay out a minimum 50 % , although we have always declared more .
this year , i hope that we are able to leave our shareholders , to  |||  whom  |||  we have already given good value with 33 % of endemol " , satisfied .
it happens , they explain , because of the cut in the anticipated growth of  |||  income  |||  from 10.5 % to 8.4 % in 2008 and from 5.5 % to 5.1 % in 2009 .
this same  |||  company  |||  has lowered the forecasted profit of antenna 3 to 4.5 % in 2008 and to 7.5 % in 2009 .
three  |||  views  |||
ibersecurities : recommends buying both shares  |||  based  |||  primarily on its high dividend yield and sustainable long - term potential .
caja madrid : viewed telecinco as better ( to accumulate ) than antenna 3 ( to  |||  keep  |||  ) for the ' multiples attractive ' and business increase .
jpmorgan : recommends to weigh carefully both cases for " similar threats " ( saturated market and worse  |||  economic  |||  climate ) .
alongside its parliamentary proceedings , that ended today with the partial voting of the congress on the amendments incorporated to the project in the senate , the government has submitted to public hearing the regulation that will  |||  develop  |||  the new law , with the aim of coming in force before the year ends .
the representatives of different groups agreed in emphasizing the efforts made by deputies and senators to negotiate and  |||  agree  |||  the best legislation for guaranteeing the protection of the investors and regulating in detail the organizations activity so that the markets work efficiently .
the mifid , which amends the securities market act , involves the modernization of financial markets , while it strengthens the investor protection , improving the supervisory powers of the comisión nacional del mercado de valores ( cnmv ) and encourages cooperation among the various  |||  supervisors  |||  of the european union .
in addition , it extends the number of systems available for the execution of financial operations , so included in the regulation are the secondary markets , the multilateral trading systems , and the internalization systems of orders , these will compete with the  |||  current  |||  stock market managers .
the law also requires investment services companies to disclose to the market the key details of their  |||  business  |||  profile , risk exposure and forms of risk management , and to keep a registry of all their operations to facilitate the supervision by the cnmv .
in their passage through the committee on economic affairs of the congress , several modifications were introduced , most notably securitised debts should be considered as a "  |||  complex  |||  " financial instrument due to its high risk for the investor , which has been demonstrated by what happened with the high risk american mortgages debts ( subprime ) .
in addition , the transposition took advantage of the directive to legally define the functions that can develop graduates in economics and finance in 30 years after the decree approbation in 1977 , that delimits the  |||  professional  |||  functions reserved to professional economists .
for its part , the senate promoted the creation of new roles in the financial sector , such as the financial advisor , who will work for hire or reward , not  |||  require  |||  sec approval and will be able to provide his services and marketing products brokerage to customers at various investment firms at the same time .
this indicator , that later serves eurostat to incorporate in the inflation rate calculation in the european union , provides a prediction of how  |||  spanish  |||  prices would evolve during november .
its publication corresponds with eurostat and the european central bank ( bce ) policy to offer high quality , timely data comparable with the ones produced in the  |||  united  |||  states .
this advanced indicator is calculated  |||  using  |||  the same procedure as that used by the consumer price index harmonized , but using different methods of statistical modelling to account for information which is n't available at the moment of its publication .
ine recalled that the information  |||  provided  |||  by the indicator is only an example , it need not necessarily coincide with the final data , which will be announced next december 14 .
" ipc will continue at relatively  |||  high  |||  levels " .
the second vice - president and economy minister , pedro solbes , has stated that the ipc  |||  increase  |||  to 4.1 % in november is a " temporary figure " , but at the same time expressed hopes that the index prices will continue at " relatively high " levels for the next months .
in any case solbes has emphasized in the congress corridors that " although the figure is not good " spanish inflation differential with respect to the monetary union continues to be " more or less " the same as in  |||  recent  |||  years .
also explained that november " has been less of a surprise " than in the previous month , when the government did not count on such a high  |||  increase  |||  .
" we  |||  expected  |||  a figure of around 4 % " , recognized the economy minister with respect to the advance data today .
virgin plans to make with  |||  northern  |||  rock 42,000 euros million in three years
at the time it needed deposits of over 25,000 million pounds , a figure that has been progressively falling in the last two months due to the distrust of its clients and in spite of the  |||  guarantee  |||  of the one hundred percent of that money offered by the government and who will maintain it until the end of the crisis .
virgin , that would rename the organization to its financial trademark virgin money , needs to get around a quarter of revenues in  |||  british  |||  banks that are deposited in next the three years to obtain those 18,000 million remaining pounds until reaching the objective of 30,000 million .
the group of the tycoon richard branson ,  |||  known  |||  for his showy advertising campaigns in the united kingdom , intends spending 50 million pounds ( about 70 million euros ) annually on publicity and marketing research to achieve his purposes .
detained the totana 's mayor for a presumed plot of city - planning  |||  corruption  |||
also  |||  arrested  |||  was a secretary of the consortium and the head of the municipal police .
agents continue registering the municipal dependants and the urban council and more arrests are not ruled out in the  |||  coming  |||  hours .
more , the object of the investigation , according to sources of the investigation , is the presumed fees charged by morales in exchange for facilitating the company / signature of a city - planning agreement with a galician construction company to requalify 200 hectares of  |||  land  |||  .
at the moment , there are eight people  |||  detained  |||  .
bono accepts to head the candidacy of the psoe for toledo and to preside over the  |||  congress  |||  if won .
the ex - defence minister josé bono has accepted the offer of the government president and  |||  general  |||  secretary of the socialists , jose luis rodriguez zapatero , to head the list of the psoe by toledo for the next general elections and to be president of the congress in case the socialists gain the general elections .
in addition , it was also pointed out that " it seems " that the manchego group socialist candidate will preside the congress if the socialists win in the  |||  next  |||  elections .
bono would replace the congress president manuel marín , that on 15th november made public his decision of not standing for the next  |||  general  |||  elections and to abandon his career in politics to dedicate himself to fight against the climatic change in the university level .
the ex -  |||  minister  |||  has recognized that the government president has not stopped insisting that he return to the political vanguard since he left two years ago .
in addition , he has indicated that , like the citizens know who will be the  |||  economic  |||  vice - president if the psoe gains the elections , they have wanted to announce who will preside over the congress , in an " act of transparency " .
if he gains office , bono hopes to turn the house into " the house of  |||  respect  |||  and not insult or shout " . and make it " more and more visible to the citizens " .
" sometimes unfortunately it appears that the only place in madrid where it is not possible to be  |||  speak  |||  with confidence and calmness is the congress , the government president on one occasion was interrupted in the senate 26 times " .
also , he has praised the  |||  current  |||  president , manuel marín and " the good work he 's doing " and has not wanted to be viewed as already occupying his post , not to fall in what , his adversaries could view as " arrogance " .
climatic  |||  propaganda  |||
given that the movement against the climatic change , put under merciless persecution by the sceptics of its predictions like those that prioritize other political and social battles , is forced to  |||  show  |||  an iron determination .
and as leader of the movement and as the president of the government zapatero thinks that this fight is more important that the one on islamic terrorism and proposes to  |||  sign  |||  a " new contract with the planet " .
that approach forces him to explain why the  |||  action  |||  , or the inaction , of the government has contributed decisively to the spanish heading the ue breach of kyoto .
who are the people  |||  responsible  |||  for the breach , in which sectors have they taken place and why his government , the contract with the planet , has not avoided it .
that is , who will be sacrificed and who will pay to  |||  save  |||  the planet .
but there has neither been nor will be  |||  explanations  |||  .
|||  indeed  |||  because someone will have to sacrifice and pay .
measures against climatic change , the  |||  real  |||  measures , are unpopular .
such as the hundredth of the gasoline suggested by the psoe , which close to the  |||  election  |||  may be dangerous to zapatero , who has hastened to deny it .
that is , which one is to  |||  save  |||  the planet without doing anything , with pure propaganda , with slogans devoid of all real consequence .
with impressive phrases , commissions , committees , protocols , new  |||  positions  |||  .
with contracts with the planet , this man , who neither speaks nor complains nor demands , but adorns rallies and inspires tenderness , is very useful for  |||  election  |||  campaigns .
always , if the contract part is  |||  limited  |||  to being only virtual , and we only pretend to move around by bicycle or to stay fresh with a fan .
detained the totana 's mayor and the  |||  head  |||  of the local police on a presumed plot of city - planning corruption
these three arrests are added to six made last monday in galicia , murcia and madrid , in an operation  |||  linked  |||  to the re - classification of more than 2 million hectares from rural land to building area , so that the galician company nuaria constructed 4,000 houses , after the payment of illegal commissions during the last legislature .
the six first arrests have gone before the  |||  court  |||  today .
according to  |||  information  |||  sources , the previous alderman of totana and actual autonomic parliamentary of the pp , juan morales , is being investigated .
in addition , the former wife , proprietor of a registered real estate agency in totana , has been arraigned , as is the  |||  current  |||  girlfriend of former alderman that resides in murcia capital .
the director and proprietor of the group nuaria , the lawyer and industrialist vigo manuel n.a. , was detained in nigrán ( pontevedra ) , as was pablo jose m.g. , ground director of inmonuar , an agency integrated with the  |||  mentioned  |||  group , and through which the bribes would have been made .
the investigation is the responsibility of the city - planning crimes group of operating central office ( uco ) of the civil guard , whose agents , in addition to the arrests , carried out eleven records , the majority to companies  |||  related  |||  to the detainees and located in madrid , vigo , murcia , pontevedra , madrid and totana .
one person was then arrested in totana , in particular , the owner of poultry product company well  |||  known  |||  in the region , that could have acted as an intermediary .
the company acquired in totana 2.2 million square meters of  |||  land  |||  that were re - classified and its project presupposed the duplication of the population of the municipality , that has 25,000 inhabitants .
if it seems to you , we are going to leave the book of the month , and see if in the meanwhile we have  |||  another  |||  awardology and other competitions .
life is  |||  change  |||  , people .
" the content of philosophy signature has come to the public attention as a result of the tragedy of the jokela 's  |||  school  |||  .
the education advisor and  |||  responsible  |||  for philosophy , pekka elo , demanded from the pages of the newspaper helsingin sanomat that professors adopt a critical attitude towards plato and affirmed that to study nietzsche is not essential in the obligatory basic course of philosophy in the institutes " .
a  |||  colleague  |||  has passed information over the introduction in the penal code of the crimes over downloading from the internet :
a. the downloading of one song would be a criminal offence carrying a penalty of six months to a  |||  year  |||  .
however , if you steal from the music store for a value inferior to 400 euros , it is  |||  considered  |||  simply a misdemeanour ( article 623,1 ) .
b. if you steal from the store up to 1000 euros , the theft already is crime , but the penalty continues being inferior to the one imposed for downloading ( article 234 of the penal  |||  code  |||  ) .
to participate in a big fight carries a penalty of three months to a year ( article 154 of the penal  |||  code  |||  ) and the interchange would have a penalty of six months to two years
( article 270 of the penal  |||  code  |||  ) .
e. sexual harassment at work is  |||  considered  |||  less serious than downloading a film on dvd , according to article 184,2 of the penal code .
f. the distribution of films protected by copyright and without the authors ' authorization carries a higher penalty than the distribution of pornographic  |||  material  |||  to minors ( article 186 ) .
well , if my colleague is  |||  right  |||  , somebody is stretching the law a bit too far .
my attending physician gave me an article on a rare investigation titled : " money produces brain activity , mainly if the others  |||  receive  |||  less ' .
that is , that the feelings that are generated by the monthly wages of the  |||  workers  |||  depends on how much colleagues earn .
a study has been made  |||  using  |||  magnetic resonance at the university of bonn , and the results have been published in the last issue of science .
i do not know if this conclusion  |||  required  |||  as much science .
which  |||  insurance  |||  is good for me ?
because choosing the right car insurance is even more  |||  difficult  |||  than choosing the vehicle model .
first we must be  |||  clear  |||  what we are talking about .
the car  |||  insurance  |||  is an agreement between an insurance agency and the insured .
the premium is the insurance price , which is  |||  established  |||  considering diverse factors , such as the age , sex , the length of membership , marital status , the type of vehicle to insure or the usage of the latter , among others .
it is for this reason that both drivers older than 25 and women have to pay lower premiums , since statistics  |||  show  |||  that they have a smaller accident index due to their prudence .
the use of the  |||  vehicle  |||  will influence the frequency , and with it in the probability of having some type of mishap .
it is for this reason , that the driver has to study his situation to  |||  choose  |||  the insurance that better adjusts his profile .
presented here are the most significant variables in  |||  choosing  |||  one or another kind of insurance that , in addition to adapt to the characteristics of the insured , offers a reasonable price .
people younger than 25 years have  |||  diverse  |||  disadvantages at the time of contracting an insurance at a reasonable price , as the reduced driving experience and the length of the membership .
|||  although  |||  , to be well insured , it is ideal to have a fully comprehensive insurance , other economic options exist .
the most cautious drivers can decide for a franchise with any  |||  risk  |||  , so that they obtain the insurance coverage , but at a price more feasible .
this class of  |||  agreement  |||  would suppose that the client cover a part of the costs in case of mishaps .
another option is an  |||  extended  |||  third party insurance , so that the client is assured protection from damages caused to third parties , although not to those caused to his own car .
an  |||  advice  |||  .
if you are younger than 25 years try to be careful and  |||  avoid  |||  accidents as far as possible , since this will be an advantage , being able to reduce the cost of the insurance in the future .
if the company has had a good year it will be able to  |||  increase  |||  the advantages " , clarifies noguera .
once over 25 years of age drivers have an easier time of contracting an insurance , since the accident index is  |||  reduced  |||  thanks to the accumulated experience .
" normally young people cannot take advantage of the experience previously acquired at the time of an accident , or even when driving " , assures the director in spain of the european company , to which adds that most of the accidents take place in the second year of driving , once the "  |||  fear  |||  of the novice " passes .
nevertheless , if the client is married but still does n't have children it is better to negotiate an comprehensive insurance , as long as his  |||  economic  |||  situation allows it , clearly .
in this case the best one is a fully comprehensive insurance with tax exemption ( this being of 300 euros ) , or , when it is had , a high benefit level , a third - party  |||  extended  |||  as the third life 's year of the vehicle .
it is necessary to say that the car insurance is something important , not only because it covers the driver over  |||  possible  |||  wrecks , but because it represents an important cost , reason for which it is fundamental to suitably study the insurance that agrees to us most according to our personal situation .
milan and celtic are playing on tuesday at san siro in search of the  |||  point  |||  they needed to achieve their respective goals in the closing of the " champions " league , as the italians are used to be first and the scots for his sentencing classification .
the italians added ten points and already certified in the fifth day pass with a tie in portugal , while celtic has nine points , but still needs another to make  |||  sure  |||  that the shakhtar , with six , and that benfica , which has four , do not overtake it .
these two matches of group d will be  |||  played  |||  in one week before the end of the sixth day , since milan has to play in the mundial de clubes in japan , where they make their debut on the 13 in the semi - finals in search of a place for the final on 16 .
so , this group will be closed before the rest and giuseppe meazza seems to expect a tie as the result , but the two teams will try to go for a win , and the italians will not want to speculate at  |||  home  |||  and celtic knows that winning would be first and would ensure a better crossing into the quarter finals .
to the gordon strachan team could serve even a defeat for classified shakhtar if not wins , but may not be trusted because equality on nine points means that the ukranians pass , who  |||  lost  |||  last week in glasgow ( 2-1 ) , but won ( 2-0 ) in another duel live .
thus , milanists threaten to make it a bitter night for the scots , who rely on getting into the quarters for the second time in a row in the restructured champions league , after they were precisely defeated in this last round by a goal from kaka in the  |||  extended  |||  time ( 1-0 ) after 0-0 in the round .
waiting for the victory of the " rossoneri " will be the shakhtar to which only the win will do , in the event that celtic  |||  lost  |||  both get into quarters to continue in the uefa .
and as to benfica , despite being the last one and without any hope of staying in the top european competition , could  |||  reach  |||  third place with a victory , which play uefa .
20,000 people in vancouver attending the first concert of the spice  |||  girls  |||  ' tour .

" sporty spice " whose departure from the group in 1998 " for the differences between us " led the dissolution of the quintet two years later , also expressed nervousness during a meeting with the press , two hours before the  |||  start  |||  of the show .
" i was nervous to see that the world 's sense has  |||  changed  |||  , the feeling about the spice girls has changed .
and i thought why not , so i am happy for having taken the decision " said chisholm about the reunion of the group that she disbanded  |||  nine  |||  years ago .
the singer also  |||  noted  |||  that over time , " things have been settled and we still love each other a lot . "
but many things have  |||  changed  |||  since the spice girls acted together for the last time in 1998 .
to  |||  begin  |||  with , according to ctv television , the group arrived at vancouver in a special virgin airlines plane .
among the five joined seven  |||  children  |||  .

new  |||  russia  |||  - ukraine gas row fears
a fresh gas price dispute is brewing between ukraine and russia , raising the risk that russian exports of the fuel to western europe may be  |||  affected  |||  .
most of russia 's gas exports to the  |||  european  |||  union ( eu ) are piped through ukraine and any row between the two nations is keenly watched .
kiev has warned that if moscow raises the price it has to pay for the gas it will  |||  charge  |||  russia higher transit fees .
a previous dispute between the two last year  |||  reduced  |||  supplies to eu states .
the latest dispute between kiev and moscow comes as the ukrainian government and russia 's state - owned gas monopoly , gazprom , try to reach agreement on how much ukraine must pay for  |||  russian  |||  gas in 2008 .
gazprom says it will have to charge ukraine more as it has  |||  agreed  |||  to pay up to 50 % extra in 2008 for gas it sources from neighbouring turkmenistan .
analysts say this could  |||  mean  |||  ukraine having to pay 40 % more for its imports from gazprom .
" it is important for us to use our arguments as one of the top gas transit states during talks , " ukraine 's economy  |||  minister  |||  anatoly kinakh told the reuters news agency .
" the changes in gas prices should no doubt be linked to our arguments about the levels of  |||  transit  |||  fees [ to western europe ] via ukraine . "
the last  |||  major  |||  gas dispute between moscow and kiev saw gazprom cut supplies to ukraine in january 2006 .
that lead to a knock - on fall in exports to  |||  western  |||  europe , which sharply pushed up prices .
|||  russian  |||  gas accounts for one - quarter of the european union 's supplies .
russia has the world 's largest  |||  stocks  |||  of gas , but much of it remains under - developed .
as a result , gazprom supplements its own supplies with gas from turkmenistan and other central asian  |||  former  |||  soviet nations .
nhs ' must  |||  check  |||  foreign workers '
scottish nhs boards need to improve  |||  criminal  |||  records checks for employees outside europe , a watchdog has said .
mr black also raised concerns that nhs scotland had no accurate picture of the number of overseas  |||  staff  |||  it had .
the auditor general looked into  |||  staff  |||  recruited outside european economic area countries , in the wake of the glasgow airport attack .
bilal abdullah , 28 , an iraqi doctor at the royal alexandra hospital in paisley , was arrested at the airport after a jeep was driven into the doors of the main terminal  |||  building  |||  .
nhs boards are expected to carry out pre - employment checks on overseas  |||  staff  |||  to ensure they have the qualifications , experience and authorisation to work in the uk.
although scots health boards use disclosure scotland to carry out criminal records checks , the agency has no  |||  jurisdiction  |||  to obtain such information outside britain .
mr black said the scottish nhs had a high level of compliance with its own pre - employment screening policies , but added : " our report highlights areas where the system can be  |||  improved  |||  to ensure that accurate information is available on the number of overseas nhs staff . "
" the report suggests that current pre - employment checks are  |||  working  |||  well in nhs scotland and it is not clear what added value the recommendations will deliver , " he said .
scottish health authorities said they currently had 1,161 overseas  |||  staff  |||  , the vast majority of them doctors and nurses .
but the auditor general warned the numbers were likely to be higher , partly because boards had problems identifying which  |||  staff  |||  were on indefinite leave to remain .
the investigation also found that  |||  established  |||  check procedures at nhs authorities in ayrshire and arran , grampian , greater glasgow and clyde , lanarkshire , and lothian were largely being met .
these included  |||  passport  |||  , work permit and qualification checks .
the  |||  scottish  |||  government is currently revising its policy and guidance on pre - employment checks for overseas staff in the nhs .
health  |||  secretary  |||  nicola sturgeon said : " i was keen to have this work carried out in the wake of the terror attack on glasgow airport .
she added the scottish government , in conjunction with health boards , would  |||  consider  |||  the recommendations of the report and would ensure best practice was reflected in updated guidance on pre - employment checks for all staff - including those from overseas - it planned to publish next month .
control , the biopic about late joy division singer ian curtis , has scooped five prizes at the  |||  british  |||  independent film awards , including best film .
trophies were also given to star sam riley , who  |||  worked  |||  in a warehouse until he was cast as curtis , director anton corbijn , and co - star toby kebbell .
dame judi dench was named  |||  best  |||  actress for thriller notes on a scandal .
rock music was the  |||  focus  |||  of another award - winner at the ceremony - as julien temple 's film about clash singer joe strummer took the best documentary prize .
the best actor gong went to viggo mortensen for his role as the driver to a  |||  russian  |||  mafia boss in david cronenberg 's london - based thriller easter promises .
ray winstone , who has a reputation for playing  |||  tough  |||  guys , picked up the richard harris award for outstanding contribution to british film .
winstone said he was  |||  proud  |||  to receive the award , named in honour of camelot and harry potter star harris , who died in 2002 .
" it was people like richard harris and albert finney that  |||  opened  |||  the doors for people like me , " he said .
he 's my type of guy , a great  |||  actor  |||  of the time , i 'm really honoured . "
the independent film awards ,  |||  known  |||  as the bifas , are selected by a panel which included filmmakers , actors and festival organisers .
bifa supporters and patrons  |||  include  |||  mike figgis , ken loach , ewan mcgregor , samantha morton , bill nighy , meera syal and michael winterbottom .
saudi arabia revealed yesterday that it had  |||  arrested  |||  208 militants for involvement in cells planning an imminent attack on an oil installation , as well as attacks on clerics and security forces .
|||  state  |||  television in the world 's biggest oil exporter said that one of the cells was planning to smuggle in missiles .
sympathisers of  |||  al-qaeda  |||  have mounted a campaign against the monarchy , an ally of the united states , since 2003 , following the invasion of iraq .
a cell of eight militants led by a foreign resident  |||  planned  |||  an attack on an oil facility in the eastern province , the tv report said .
it said the militants had  |||  planned  |||  to smuggle eight projectiles into the kingdom .
another 22 of those detained were reported to be plotting to assassinate clerics and  |||  security  |||  forces .
al-qaeda militants regard many clerics in saudi arabia as having been co - opted by the authorities into  |||  supporting  |||  the policies of the royal family , which dominates government .
" this was a very large effort by security forces over the past ... five months , " an interior ministry spokesman  |||  told  |||  state television .
those arrested also included 32 people accused of  |||  providing  |||  financial support to militants .
climate on venus may be glimpse of future for  |||  earth  |||
venus may  |||  once  |||  have been a pleasant place to live , scientists said yesterday .
data from an orbiting  |||  european  |||  spacecraft show the planet is even more like a wayward twin of earth than was previously realised .
the two worlds are about the same size and occupy similar orbits ,  |||  although  |||  venus is slightly closer to the sun.
billions of years ago , venus would have had conditions very  |||  similar  |||  to those on earth and may even have been habitable , scientists now believe .
but a runaway carbon dioxide greenhouse effect , atmospheric erosion by solar radiation , and a slower rotation rate  |||  sent  |||  venus down a very different development path .
today the planet is stripped of water , has a surface temperature hot enough to melt  |||  lead  |||  and is ravaged by hurricane - force winds and lightning storms .
the findings from the european space agency 's venus express probe , which has been studying the planet for a year , offer a sobering  |||  view  |||  of how earth might develop given catastrophic changes to its climate .
" our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which venus  |||  started  |||  out like the earth , possibly with a habitable environment , billions of years ago . "
' enriched uranium ' seized by  |||  police  |||
a kilo of radioactive material ,  |||  reported  |||  to be enriched uranium , was seized by slovak and hungarian police yesterday .
he would not confirm if it was enriched uranium but said it could have been  |||  sold  |||  for $ 1 million ( gbp 480,000 ) .
nonetheless , the republican candidates for the presidency eventually  |||  agreed  |||  to face a youtube debate , in which ordinary voters recorded questions on video and submitted them for broadcast to the candidates .
none of the questions aired on the evening of wednesday november 28th were quite as ridiculous as the snowman who asked democrats about global warming in the other party 's youtube  |||  debate  |||  .
but the questions , and answers , this time  |||  reflected  |||  much about the state of the republican party heading into next year 's election .
but the first half - hour of the debate , the longest dedicated to any single issue ,  |||  focused  |||  on immigration .
the  |||  subject  |||  is one of the most potent topics for republicans .
he attacked mr romney , accusing the former massachusetts governor of hiring  |||  illegal  |||  immigrants to work on his house .
the two sparred particularly fiercely as questioners asked if any candidate would support an " amnesty " (  |||  giving  |||  illegal immigrants a regular status and the possibility of citizenship ) .
minor candidates like duncan hunter , a californian congressman , and tom tancredo , a congressman from colorado , managed to get digs in on the  |||  subject  |||  .
neither man has a prayer at the nomination , but both remain in the race perhaps because they  |||  started  |||  beating the immigration drum earlier and harder than others .
at least on immigration the candidates , broadly , share the same views : tougher borders , intolerance for  |||  illegal  |||  migrants .
this topic , along with fears of toxic toys from china or other worries about the outside  |||  world  |||  , helps republicans forget , or minimise , the divisions between libertarians and christian conservatives .
mr giuliani was asked why he had  |||  supported  |||  gun control in the past .
one questioner asked if the candidates believed  |||  every  |||  word of the bible .
this led mr giuliani to stumble towards the  |||  position  |||  that while the bible was his favourite book , he perhaps did not literally believe in the story of jonah and the whale .
another questioner asked whether jesus would  |||  support  |||  the death penalty .
mike huckabee - now , against all expectations , in first place in a recent poll from iowa thanks to his longstanding christian conservatism - said that the death penalty was painful but  |||  necessary  |||  .
the race  |||  remains  |||  unusually wide open .
mr huckabee 's surge in iowa coincides with the libertarian ron paul 's recent fundraising feats and his hooting cheers at wednesday 's  |||  debate  |||  .
these two have surged from the bottom because the party 's two wings cannot yet  |||  agree  |||  on one of the better - known and more traditional candidates .
in 1980 and 2000 , a candidate united the party  |||  early  |||  and convincingly with a winning message about america 's greatness and winks to both of the party 's wings .
|||  labour  |||  pains
gordon brown has discovered yet another hole to  |||  fall  |||  into ; his way out of it remains the same
as  |||  british  |||  political scandals go , this one is not particularly juicy .
no honours seem to have been  |||  sold  |||  , no politician 's parisian hotel bills picked up , no extramarital toes sucked .
but the revelation that a rich businessman disguised contributions to britain 's  |||  governing  |||  labour party of more than gbp 650,000 ( $ 1. 3m ) over four years under other people 's names , and that the party failed to report it , is one the embattled gordon brown could well have done without .
two months ago , when the prime minister ducked out of calling an election , stupidly insulting britons ' intelligence by claiming that opinion polls had not influenced this decision , the hope was that he would  |||  provide  |||  sturdy , efficient government .
the cack - handed rescue of northern rock , a troubled bank , showed regulatory weakness and poor judgment under  |||  fire  |||  .
ill - thought - out proposals to change the tax code have drawn  |||  business  |||  groups together against the government .
the tax authority 's loss of 25m people 's personal  |||  details  |||  revealed unimaginable administrative bungling .
now there are the multifaceted donations from david abrahams ; peter watt , labour 's  |||  general  |||  secretary ( and its previous head of compliance ) , has already resigned .
none of this  |||  means  |||  that mr brown is headed irrevocably for the exit .
once it seems clear that a prime minister is unlikely to improve things , and may not even be around for long , that suspension is over : the civil service starts leaking ; cabinet ministers  |||  start  |||  briefing ; the press looks for bad - news stories ; and government becomes defensive and unfocused .
in one way , mr brown 's position is particularly  |||  difficult  |||  , because unlike other political leaders he cannot claim to be a new broom .
much though he would like to disown tony  |||  blair  |||  , he was his senior lieutenant .
the problems to do with northern rock and the tax - authority records , for instance , are  |||  linked  |||  to decisions mr brown made as chancellor of the exchequer .
and even when he was not directly  |||  involved  |||  in blairish mishaps - such as the long " cash for peerages " inquiry into political - party funding - voters may well assume he was .
yet mr  |||  brown  |||  's predicament is not quite as bad as it looks .
the new fuss about  |||  political  |||  donations is a good example .
that may be so , but the  |||  decision  |||  was not his to make .
the laws against anonymity for big political contributors are  |||  clear  |||  and they exist for a clear reason : the public is entitled to know who may be buying access to those who rule the land .
so far the  |||  prime minister  |||  has done half the job .
he was quick to condemn his party 's breach of the law , but he diluted that decisiveness by reaching for a familiar tool , a committee of inquiry into the  |||  matter  |||  - led , for good measure , by a retired bishop and a judge .
in this case , the " lessons to be learned " are not  |||  complicated  |||  .
if the law has been broken , it is a  |||  matter  |||  for the police .
besides , there are other things that mr brown needs to do , such as finding a  |||  permanent  |||  chairman for the independent committee on standards in public life , which has been without one for six months , and pressing ahead with genuine reform of political - party funding .
but he should  |||  face  |||  some partisan facts .
the conservatives now have a decent lead in the polls ; he has two years to win  |||  back  |||  voters ; and the only way he can grind out a victory is through unimpeachable probity and solid competence .
|||  card  |||  sharks
is the subprime  |||  mortgage  |||  crisis infecting america 's credit - card market ?
when there is blood in the water , it is only natural that dorsal fins swirl  |||  around  |||  excitedly .
now that america 's housing market is ailing , predators have their sights on the country 's credit -  |||  card  |||  market .
analysts at goldman sachs reckon that credit - card losses could reach $ 99 billion if contagion spreads from subprime mortgages to other forms of consumer  |||  credit  |||  .
signs of  |||  strain  |||  are clearly visible .
there are rises in both the charge - off and delinquency rates , which measure the share of balances that are uncollectible or more than 30 days  |||  late  |||  respectively .
hsbc announced  |||  last  |||  month that it had taken a $ 1.4 billion charge in its american consumer - finance business , partly because of weakness among card borrowers .
it is too  |||  early  |||  to panic , though .
according to moody 's , a rating agency , the third - quarter delinquency rate of 3.89 % was almost a full percentage  |||  point  |||  below the historical average .
the deterioration in  |||  rates  |||  can be partly explained by technical factors .
a change in america 's personal - bankruptcy laws in 2005 led to an abrupt  |||  fall  |||  in bankruptcy filings , which in turn account for a big chunk of credit - card losses ; the number of filings ( and thus charge - off rates ) would be rising again , whether or not overall conditions for borrowers were getting worse .
the industry also reports solid payment rates , which  |||  show  |||  how much of their debt consumers pay off each month .
and confidence in credit - card asset - backed securities is pretty  |||  firm  |||  despite paralysis in other corners of structured finance .
dennis moroney of towergroup , a research  |||  firm  |||  , predicts that issuance volumes for 2007 will end up being 25 % higher than last year .
but card issuers look at cash flow rather than asset values , so falling  |||  house  |||  prices do not necessarily trigger a change in borrowers ' creditworthiness .
they may even work to issuers '  |||  advantage  |||  .
the incentives for consumers to keep  |||  paying  |||  the mortgage decrease if properties are worth less than the value of the loan ; card debt rises higher up the list of repayment priorities as a result .
card issuers are also able to respond much more swiftly and flexibly to stormier conditions than mortgage lenders are , by  |||  changing  |||  interest rates or altering credit limits .
that should in theory  |||  reduce  |||  the risk of a rapid repricing of assets .
" we are not going to wake up one day and totally revalue the loans , " says gary perlin ,  |||  capital  |||  one 's chief financial officer .
if a sudden subprime - style meltdown in the credit - card market is improbable , the risks of a sustained downturn are much more  |||  real  |||  .
if lower house prices and a contraction in credit push america into recession , the industry will undoubtedly  |||  face  |||  a grimmer future .
|||  british  |||  bankers plead guilty in enron case
three british bankers who were set to go to trial for their roles in a fraudulent scheme with former enron chief financial officer andrew fastow  |||  changed  |||  their pleas to guilty wednesday .
david bermingham , giles darby and gary mulgrew had originally pleaded innocent to seven counts of wire  |||  fraud  |||  for allegedly colluding with fastow in a secret financial scam in 2000 to enrich themselves at their employers ' expense .
they were set to go on  |||  trial  |||  in january .
but during a court hearing before u.s. district judge ewing werlein jr. ,  |||  each  |||  pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud .
the three former executives at greenwich natwest , a unit of royal bank of scotland group plc , became a cause celebre in britain  |||  throughout  |||  extradition proceedings that lasted two years .
in the united states , their  |||  case  |||  is a loose end of an investigation launched after enron 's 2001 collapse .
charges initially filed against them in 2002 alerted fastow that he was a target of the  |||  government  |||  's investigation into enron 's downfall .
the indictment against the bankers -- dubbed the " natwest three " -- alleges they  |||  came  |||  to houston in 2000 to concoct a fraudulent scheme with fastow and his former top aide , michael kopper .
greenwich natwest had invested in a subsidiary of an enron partnership  |||  controlled  |||  by fastow , who was the architect of a myriad of fraudulent enron schemes that helped fuel its spiral into bankruptcy proceedings .
in early 2002 , the bank had valued its interest in the subsidiary at zero , but the three british men knew it actually had  |||  significant  |||  value .
the bankers  |||  paid  |||  kopper $ 250,000 for an interest in this company .
according to the indictment , fastow falsely represented to enron that the  |||  energy  |||  company would pay $ 20 million to greenwich natwest for its shares of the subsidiary .
but the $ 20 million actually went to the british bankers , fastow and  |||  others  |||  .
the bankers got $ 7.3 million while fastow , kopper and  |||  others  |||  skimmed about $ 12.3 million , according to the indictment .
in january 2004 , fastow pleaded guilty to two counts of conspiracy for his role in enron 's  |||  collapse  |||  .
the british trio was  |||  arrested  |||  three months later .
fastow is serving a six - year sentence in a  |||  federal  |||  prison in louisiana .
kopper is serving a three - year , one - month  |||  sentence  |||  at a facility in texarkana .
each of the three british men have been  |||  free  |||  on $ 1 million bonds that required them to live in the united states pending trial .
enron , once the nation 's seventh - largest company , crumbled into bankruptcy in december 2001 after years of accounting tricks could no longer hide billions in debt or make failing ventures  |||  appear  |||  profitable .
the collapse wiped out thousands of  |||  jobs  |||  , more than $ 60 billion in market value and more than $ 2 billion in pension plans .
enron founder kenneth lay and former chief executive jeffrey skilling were convicted  |||  last  |||  year for their roles in the company 's collapse .
lay 's convictions for conspiracy , fraud and other charges were wiped out after he died of  |||  heart  |||  disease last year .
but that is small change to some of the  |||  russian  |||  rich .
" it seats up to 18 passengers , " said dan firer , a gulfstream  |||  representative  |||  .
mr. firer was manning the gulfstream booth  |||  last  |||  friday at the millionaire fair , a four - day orgy of conspicuous consumption held at a cavernous exhibition centre on the outskirts of the capital .
" that 's a  |||  nice  |||  car , but it is nickels and dimes compared to us , " he said .
" after the  |||  united  |||  states , russia is the second - biggest market for private aircraft . "
fueled by an oil boom , the  |||  russian  |||  capital seems as awash in cash as dallas was in its heyday .
" we went through the same thing in the 1890s when some americans came into giant wealth and flocked to europe , where they were viewed as materialistic , " said marshall goldman , a senior scholar at the davis centre for  |||  russian  |||  and eurasian studies at harvard university .
the most exclusive luxury brands are  |||  seeking  |||  their share of the klondike .
( the conference is organized by the international herald tribune , which is owned by the new york times  |||  company  |||  . )
russia has 53 billionaires worth a  |||  total  |||  of $ 282 billion , according to the forbes list of the richest people .
in  |||  addition  |||  , the second - tier rich include 103,000 russian millionaires who are collectively worth $ 670 billion , according to a study on the evolution of personal wealth in the former soviet union written by economists at the centre for economic and financial research , a think tank here .
( the world  |||  bank  |||  says that in 2005 , 15.8 percent of russians lived below subsistence level . )
" there are hundreds of millionaires in moscow - that is why we are all here , " said nicole marais , a sales and marketing  |||  representative  |||  for david morris , the london jeweller .
she was attending the  |||  fair  |||  for the first time in conjunction with the brand 's russian distributor , the soho jewelry group .
" the  |||  women  |||  are all impeccably groomed and the men are all worth a fortune . "
wandering the halls sunday night , dressed in evening attire , two real estate agents , evgenia yumatova , 21 , and svetlana turovtsova , 26 , described both  |||  themselves  |||  and their clients as millionaires .
" i was looking at the cars and i 'm trying to  |||  decide  |||  between the infiniti , the mercedes and the porsche , " said ms. yumatova , who reeled off the designer clothing she was wearing like a red carpet veteran dishing with joan rivers .
the fair seemed primarily  |||  aimed  |||  at the nouveaux riches , the type of brand - driven russian shoppers who would be willing to sit through several hours of traffic to tour a drafty warehouse that gaudily juxtaposed cadillac escalades , platinum penknives , mövenpick ice cream , custom pool tables , apartments in dubai and gund teddy bears .
|||  members  |||  of the general public could buy tickets for 30 euros ( $ 44.57 ) .
" russians are interested in learning what brand is the most expensive and the best , " said mr. gijrath , who was sitting patriotically at a booth of the  |||  dutch  |||  porcelain manufacturer royal delft , in front of a wall - size re - creation of a rembrandt painting made of hand - painted blue tile .
" of course ,  |||  russians  |||  are more interested in bling - bling . "
on the first night of the show last thursday , roman ershov , the  |||  general  |||  manager of king koil beds here , said he had sold two $ 70,000 mattress sets made of silk , cashmere and cotton , interwoven with gold threads .
also on the first night , mikhail lyubiumov , the sales manager for a 1 moto , a company that outfits high - end cars with high - end alarm systems , said that his company had  |||  sold  |||  the bright orange porsche , for $ 170,000 , to a russian millionaire .
by sunday afternoon , andrei karapetian , the president of l.a. connection , a company that customizes luxury cars , said he had  |||  sold  |||  three car grilles , resembling interlinked chain bracelets , for rolls - royce phantoms , at $ 55,000 each .
he showed a reporter a car wheel ,  |||  designed  |||  for a russian casino owner , with spokes that he had encrusted with coloured swarovski crystals so that it looked like a roulette wheel .
the cost : $ 22,000 for a set of  |||  four  |||  .
even if many of his russian clients are rich , mr. karapetian said the phrase " russian millionaire " did not convey much exclusivity at the  |||  moment  |||  , given the surge in real estate prices here .
" if you bought an apartment in moscow three or four years ago , you are probably already a millionaire , at least on  |||  paper  |||  if not in cash , " he said .
those who were not millionaires could at least pretend to be rich at the  |||  stand  |||  run by alliance continental , a russian asset management firm .
the company had erected four red  |||  british  |||  - style telephone booths , stuffed with piles of counterfeit million - dollar greenbacks .
passers - by stopped to toss piles of money  |||  around  |||  , ask their friends to snap cellphone images of them reclining amid ersatz wealth , or just to pocket a couple of million .
" you see , in moscow , everyone can  |||  feel  |||  himself a millionaire , " mr. karryev said .
botched surgery suspected in a  |||  death  |||  in new jersey
|||  soon  |||  , there was a police patrol car .
and then there was  |||  another  |||  .
" that 's when i knew  |||  somebody  |||  was gone . "
now investigators are trying to determine whether she died because of a procedure performed by an unlicensed cosmetic surgeon , whom the police did not identify ,  |||  working  |||  in the house at 212 west scott avenue .
the authorities have not yet determined what  |||  caused  |||  ms. arroyo 's death , and are hopeful that toxicology tests , the results of which might not be available for weeks , will help solve a mysterious death that has sent a spasm of grief through the top ranks of the newark police .
ms. arroyo had been an assistant to the police director , garry f. mccarthy , since september 2006 , and her voice was  |||  familiar  |||  to many in the department .
" she was loyal ,  |||  hard  |||  - working and tenacious , " mr. mccarthy said of ms. arroyo in a telephone interview on wednesday .
she would  |||  protect  |||  me . "
mr. mccarthy said that ms. arroyo was the wife of jimmy arroyo , a  |||  former  |||  newark police officer who works for the alcoholic beverage control commission , and that she leaves two sons , 14 and 11 , and a stepdaughter .
eileen walsh , a spokeswoman for the union county prosecutor , theodore j. romankow , said that detectives were trying to determine whether ms. arroyo  |||  died  |||  as the result of an unlicensed surgical procedure .
" that 's one of the  |||  possibilities  |||  , " ms. walsh said .
the authorities said they arrived at the  |||  house  |||  about 3 p.m. on nov.
more than a week has gone by , and the authorities have said  |||  little  |||  about their investigation or about the owner of the house , who is listed as flor margarita castro .
ms. walsh would not say whether ms. castro had been interviewed by the  |||  authorities  |||  .
investigators are trying to  |||  determine  |||  whether part of the house was used as a medical office .
on  |||  wednesday  |||  , no one answered the door at ms. castro 's home , where a withered rosebush stood in the narrow front yard and a dalmatian barked in the back .
a  |||  blue  |||  drum labelled " ethyl vanillin " - used as a substitute for vanilla in foods and perfumes - sat in a carport , next to a door that led to the basement .
two  |||  mountain  |||  bikes hung from hooks off to one side .
mr. mccarthy said that when he first arrived in newark after spending 25 years with the new york police department , ms. arroyo was invaluable in helping him navigate his new city 's insular and rough - hewn  |||  political  |||  culture .
hopes that fed will cut rates  |||  lead  |||  to world stock market surge
stock markets surged in london , new york and across europe after donald kohn , no 2 to ben bernanke , the fed 's chairman , said that policymakers must be " flexible and pragmatic " in responding to  |||  continued  |||  stress in financial markets .
in a clear effort to reassure fretful markets amid signs of resurgent  |||  credit  |||  strains , mr kohn said that recent turbulence had " partly reversed some of the improvement in market functioning over the late part of september and in october " .
should the elevated turbulence persist , it would  |||  increase  |||  the possibility of further tightening in financial conditions for households and businesses , he said .
the comments were taken by investors as a signal that the fed stands ready to step in with fresh injections of capital into us markets , and possible further interest rate cuts , to stabilise  |||  credit  |||  conditions .
the remarks also helped to calm wall street amid more bad news on the us economy , as  |||  sales  |||  of us homes hit a record low in october .
the fallout from financial turmoil was emphasised by an announcement from bear stearns , the investment bank , that it will cut 650 jobs , or 4 per cent of its global workforce , in a round of cost - cutting to offset heavy losses from its losing bets on the us sub - prime  |||  home  |||  loans sector .
only 20 of those  |||  posts  |||  are expected to go in london , where the bank employs 1,500 people .
in new york , the dow jones industrial average jumped by 331 points , or 2.55 per cent , to  |||  close  |||  at 13,289.40 , while the broader - based s&p 500 index rose by 2.65 per cent .
germany 's dax index  |||  rose  |||  2.6 per cent , and france 's cac 40 was up 2.3 per cent .
earlier , the re - emergence of  |||  credit  |||  stress in the markets was high - lighted after strong demand in an auction of three - month funds by the european central bank saw those loaned to europe 's commercial banks at a hefty 4.7 per cent , the highest rate since april 2001 .
pressure on the bank of england to  |||  follow  |||  the fed and ecb and inject extra funds into money markets in london mounted as credit strains saw three - month " libor " rates for lending between uk banks pushed to their highest since late september , at 6.59 per cent , after a steady climb since november 12 .
here are two dilemmas , each almost as  |||  difficult  |||  as the other .
who should bat at no 6 for  |||  england  |||  in kandy this weekend , owais shah or ravi bopara ?
and , no less  |||  relevant  |||  in a wider context than the first test against sri lanka , who should make the decision ?
the second question is  |||  relevant  |||  because david graveney , the chairman of selectors who is on borrowed time under that particular title at least , is here to help peter moores , the head coach , and michael vaughan , the captain , to decide and because the desk of hugh morris , the england managing director , is starting to fill up with applications to become national selector , if not a part - time one .
it is not only in cricket that selection is  |||  difficult  |||  , requiring judgment that always has to be subjective in the end .
who is to say what the  |||  right  |||  level is for a cricketer , unless he is given the chance to sink or swim at the next one ?
|||  figures  |||  , naturally , have a large bearing on decisions , but so do opportunities .
within a team , a cricketer has to catch the captain 's eye at the  |||  right  |||  time if he is to take a wicket and a batsman has to get regular chances up the order if he is to make an impact as a one - day cricketer .
there were many who did better last season , for example , than james anderson , who looks  |||  certain  |||  to play in the first test even if stephen harmison declares himself fit and bowls like the wind in the nets .
anderson took 32 first - class wickets at 33 runs  |||  each  |||  to earn a place on this tour .
chris tremlett  |||  took  |||  only 29 at the same modest average , but both have had their moments at the highest level and hope for more of them .
whether shah or bopara plays at the asgiriya stadium can be only a  |||  matter  |||  of opinion .
four years ago in sri lanka , gareth batty played in every test and did well in the first , with five wickets and 40 useful runs , but it was paul collingwood , struggling to establish himself at the same time , who came through to become a substantial test cricketer and , despite scoring a  |||  double  |||  hundred against australia in australia , may still be underestimated .
the probability is that graveney , vaughan and moores , after one more discussion in the wake of today 's net session at the asgiriya stadium , will  |||  follow  |||  their conservative instincts and plump for shah 's greater experience over bopara 's youthful exuberance .
there are  |||  arguments  |||  for both .
but shah made only ten runs in his two innings in may against west indies in the test at lord 's , his  |||  home  |||  venue as a middlesex player , and that , plus the immediate rejection by the selectors when vaughan was fit to reclaim his place for the next match , seems to have taken from his batting some of the élan that was evident in bombay .
bopara is much the better fielder , he is bowling his skiddy medium pace to some  |||  effect  |||  here on pitches that seem to suit him and is batting with confidence and skill .
choosing the right man is one thing , choosing the right  |||  moment  |||  another .
perhaps that is the  |||  real  |||  art of selection .
my inclination would be to give bopara his chance now , which is not to say that shah might not excel if , as the ceylon tea leaves  |||  suggest  |||  , it is he who plays here this weekend .
the first bus loads of iraqi refugees from syria  |||  started  |||  arriving in baghdad yesterday , spewing out exiles who had run out of cash or visa extensions and others who hoped that the city was returning to normality .
some had even come back to fight the militants who drove them from their  |||  homes  |||  .
at the mansour bus station , even before the arrival from damascus of 800 people in an official government convoy of a dozen buses , the terminal was busy with refugees from syria and jordan who had  |||  returned  |||  in private transport .
" i decided to go to syria after they  |||  killed  |||  many doctors in baghdad , " sabah al-qubaisi , a sunni doctor , said .
" i  |||  returned  |||  today because of what i saw on tv and what i keep reading in the newspapers , about what happened to baghdad and how it was safe now .
they say the mahdi army  |||  stopped  |||  killing people , " he said , referring to the shia militia of militant cleric moqtada al-sadr , who has ordered his forces to stand down for the moment .
qassim al atwani , a 38 - year - old shia teacher from the predominantly sunni area of amariyah , returned with his two children because he was  |||  unable  |||  to renew his syrian visa and because the regime prevented iraqis from working .
his shia neighbours in amariyah telephoned to tell him that a local us - backed militia force had helped to drive al-qaeda out from their bastion in the west of the capital , and urged him to  |||  return  |||  .
one of the new arrivals from jordan was the head of a sunni and shia tribe who had been driven from his  |||  home  |||  in sleikh in northern baghdad by a grenade attack after he urged his fellow citizens to rise up to fight al-qaeda .
he had come back to  |||  fight  |||  .
many spoke of being lured by the  |||  increased  |||  calm in the capital since the us troop surge and growth of local " concerned citizens groups " , armed and working with the us military to defend their neighbourhoods .
salaam al-samarrai , a 51 - year - old father of three , gave voice to common suspicion among the exiles that nouri al-maliki , the shia prime minister , had asked the syrian government to impose visa restriction on the refugees to force people to  |||  return  |||  .
more than two and  |||  half  |||  million people are believed to have fled the country 's sectarian death squads .
" we were ok until al-maliki visited syria and pushed the government to stop  |||  giving  |||  the iraqis visas , to force them to go back to iraq , " the sunni pensioner said .
" i ca n't trust a government that supports the criminals who burnt down my house after i  |||  left  |||  . "
there are fears that a sudden influx of refugees will stir up sectarian tensions again and lead to  |||  fighting  |||  .
in one field of  |||  education  |||  , however , saarland citizens are affected by the same shortcomings as the rest of the country .
at the same time , france and luxemburg play major roles in saarland 's educational system , which , according to a so - called education monitor of the german business institute ( iw ) , cologne , ranks  |||  fifth  |||  .
saarbrücken 's university was founded by the  |||  french  |||  in 1948 .
even now ,  |||  students  |||  there have the opportunity to obtain bi - national or even tri - national degrees .
as a consequence , the share of foreign students is  |||  large  |||  , making up 15.6 percent .
" in saarland , many people make use of the vocational education system , "  |||  says  |||  axel plünnecke , education expert at the iw .
more than  |||  every  |||  fifth adolescent acquires their higher - education entrance qualification at a vocational school , which places saarland above the federal average by more than seven percentage points .
opportunities to  |||  combine  |||  vocational and academic education are developed comparatively strongly .
relative to  |||  population  |||  , the supply of combined vocational and academic studies ranks second in germany .
despite a practice - oriented education and  |||  increasing  |||  demand , the number of engineering graduates has declined by a third in recent years .
consequently , saarland 's department of education is committing university - level institutions to a marketing campaign for  |||  engineering  |||  sciences .
" after the first pisa survey , we initiated a number of reforms at  |||  general  |||  - education schools , " a spokeswoman for the department of education says .
for instance , the  |||  government  |||  introduced statewide comparative tests .
whether the students ' performance has  |||  improved  |||  substantially , future comparative surveys will show .
the 2003 pisa survey showed the share of at - risk  |||  students  |||  shrinking from 29 to 20 percent .
|||  overall  |||  , saarland did not improve as much as other german federal states , however .
bavarins are  |||  better  |||  at mathematics .
and , much to the chagrin of saarlanders , pisa does not evaluate foreign  |||  language  |||  skills -- an area in which they might score .
after all , studying the neighbours ' language is mandatory at college - preparatory high schools - even  |||  though  |||  saarlanders are not frenchmen .
in venezuela ,  |||  times  |||  are about to change .
president hugo chávez has decreed that time - pieces in the south american country be turned  |||  back  |||  by half an hour on december 9 .
in spain , meanwhile , chávez is  |||  becoming  |||  a figure of ridicule .
according to the  |||  official  |||  gazette of venezuela , a new law decrees that clocks be set to gmt minus four and a half hours .
thereby , the south american state creates its own time  |||  zone  |||  that does not apply to any other country in the world .
chávez , whose disposition towards the us has been hostile , cited a number of reasons for his decision . notably , he alleged that the world 's division into time  |||  zones  |||  according to full clock hours was an imposition by the united states .
on wednesday ( local time ) , chávez also announced a severance of diplomatic  |||  ties  |||  with neighbouring country colombia due to a hostage crisis .
as long as conservative alvaro uribe remained president of colombia , the left - wing  |||  nationalist  |||  said , he would not entertain relations with colombia 's head of state , nor with its government .
" my dignity does not permit it , " said chávez . he is pushing for a constitutional  |||  reform  |||  on which citizens of the petroleum - exporting country get to vote in a referendum on sunday .
the  |||  reform  |||  would provide a significant extension of his domestic power .
the dispute was caused by uribe 's decision to revoke chávez 's mandate to  |||  negotiate  |||  the release of hostages with marxist rebels in colombia .
uribe 's decision was a " slap in the  |||  face  |||  " for venezuela , chávez had complained on sunday .
chávez is the  |||  talk  |||  of the town in spain , as well .
it was  |||  spoken  |||  by king juan carlos of spain . annoyed by the left - wing populist 's incessant interjections , juan carlos had rebuked him at the most recent ibero - american summit .
despite a  |||  strong  |||  economy , wage earners in germany have to fear a drop in actual wages in 2007 , projections say .
" the causes are a modest wage growth , the value - added tax  |||  increase  |||  and price advances for food and energy , " gustav horn of the institute for macroeconomics and economic research told the daily newspaper " bild . "
on tuesday , it was revealed that exploding prices for  |||  food  |||  and petroleum products were resulting in the highest inflation rate in 13 years .
venus is earth 's hellish  |||  twin  |||
for almost three  |||  decades  |||  , scientists suspected the existence of lightning on venus .
now , the european probe " venus express " brings confirmation -- it has detected electromagnetic waves at the edge of the atmosphere : on venus , lightning is leaping from cloud to cloud in a height of 56 kilometres , reports christopher russel of the university of california , los angeles , in the science magazine "  |||  nature  |||  . "
according to the  |||  famous  |||  " primordial soup theory , " life on earth was conditioned by lightning : supposedly , thunderstorms prompted reactions in the ocean which in turn led to the creation of amino acids , the building blocks of life .
not so on venus : " if life  |||  ever  |||  existed there , it had to have been in the planet 's very early history , " explains sean solomon of the carnegie institution , washington .
today , chances of life existing on the surface of venus are slim : the  |||  atmosphere  |||  is about one hundred times denser than on earth , with temperatures of up to 500 degrees .
" venus may be a devilish twin of  |||  earth  |||  , but a twin it is , " russel said .
the key question of the esa mission is why venus , which is so similar to earth in terms of mass and size , has undergone such a fundamentally  |||  different  |||  evolution .
the latest research results are now being presented in several "  |||  nature  |||  " articles . according to the scientists , they do not just emphasize the uniqueness of venus in the solar system .
" they also  |||  show  |||  that the similarities between our neighbouring planet and earth are greater than initially anticipated , " esa reports .
in addition to the  |||  known  |||  whirlwind at the north pole , for instance , the researchers discovered a whirl of clouds at the south pole , spinning at a significantly higher velocity .
the phenomenon is reminiscent of air currents in earth 's winter hemisphere , writes a research team of the  |||  italian  |||  istituto di astrofisica spaziale e fisica cosmica .
the planet , which is also known as morning star or evening star , orbits the sun in just under 225  |||  days  |||  .
its rotation is much slower , however : one venus day equals 243 earth  |||  days  |||  .
water accumulated on both planets . on earth it remained in oceans , whereas on venus it escaped into  |||  space  |||  .
köhler defends merkel 's  |||  meeting  |||  with dalai lama
german federal president köhler is  |||  demanding  |||  an end to the party dispute on the dalai lama 's formal reception at the federal chancellery .
he indirectly criticized the social democratic party because of its attacks on the chancellor after september 's  |||  meeting  |||  .
worried about germany 's reputation ,  |||  german  |||  federal president horst köhler asked the grand coalition to end its dispute on the dalai lama 's formal reception .
" we should not face the world as a nation that is divided on this  |||  issue  |||  , " köhler told the trade journal " handelsblatt . "
at the same time , köhler signalled his appreciation of the  |||  dalai lama  |||  's formal reception by federal chancellor angela merkel , a christian democrat , in september .
" i consider human rights to be universal , even though i  |||  respect  |||  the diversity of cultures , " köhler said .
" the  |||  chancellor  |||  has not departed from our traditional policy towards china .
|||  secretary  |||  of state frank - walter steinmeier , a social democrat , had indirectly expressed displeasure at the dalai lama 's formal reception , leading to attacks from the ranks of the christian democratic union .
in the wake of the dalai lama 's formal reception at the federal chancellery , there had been severe discordances in german -  |||  chinese  |||  relations .
for instance , the  |||  chinese  |||  government not only cancelled the inviation to german secretary of the treasury peer steinbrück , a social democrat ; according to news magazine " der spiegel , " it also suspended the so - called strategically dialogue between the two countries ' state departments .
china 's head of government wen jiabao has now asked german federal chancellor angela merkel to concede that the dalai lama 's formal  |||  reception  |||  was a mistake .
stating china 's disapproval of european officials receiving the spiritual leader of the tibetans , wen jiabao underlined the  |||  chinese  |||  position .
the dalai lama 's actions and words showed his intention to  |||  separate  |||  tibet and the broader tibetan region , which also includes other present - day provinces , from china , wen jiabao said .
clashes with the police , shots fired , burning cars : wolfgang schäuble warns of riots  |||  similar  |||  to those in france .
barricades were set aflame and rioters fired shotguns at the police : in the wake of the massive youth riots in france , german federal  |||  secretary  |||  of the interior wolfgang schäuble , of the christian democratic union , fears similar developments in germany .
" we have to prevent the rise of  |||  social  |||  tensions which may escalate in violence .
we need to take this  |||  seriously  |||  , " he told the hannover - based daily newspaper " neue presse . "
federal , state and local governments were already  |||  hard  |||  at work on the issues , said schäuble .
these were not  |||  limited  |||  to the integration of migrants , he added .
" between the german summit for integration and the conference on german -  |||  islamic  |||  affairs , we are beginning to see results . "
at the same time , schäuble pointed out that german suburbs were not suffering from the same urban - construction and sociological  |||  issues  |||  as their french counterparts .
in suburbs north of paris , there had been violent clashes between youths and the  |||  police  |||  in recent nights .
cars and  |||  public  |||  buildings were set on fire in toulouse , as well .
but there was still a need for  |||  action  |||  .
the unemployment  |||  rate  |||  among youths with a migrational background below the age of 25 was " above average , " kolat noted .
" we need to provide options to these youths , " kolat  |||  emphasized  |||  .
in addition , many youths did not want to destroy what their parents had  |||  built  |||  for themselves in germany , he said .
" we still need to be  |||  careful  |||  , " kolat urged .
youths  |||  needed  |||  to be " given the opportunity to participate in labour and education . "
in the parisian suburb villiers - le - bel , the night  |||  remained  |||  quiet , meanwhile .
hundreds of policemen were on alert , and a helicopter circled the  |||  area  |||  with searchlights .
after visiting the suburb , secretary of the interior michelle alliot - marie announced that police crackdowns would continue as long as  |||  necessary  |||  .
in the following night , the  |||  unrest  |||  encroached upon toulouse .
the riots were ignited by a  |||  traffic  |||  accident which had caused the deaths of two youths on sunday .
according to an initial investigation by the office of the district attorney , the police were not to  |||  blame  |||  in the two youths ' deaths .
after her desolate performance at the bundestag 's  |||  general  |||  debate , which was cloddy and bereft of substance , the verdict is : not this one -- not in the country she ought to be governing .
at the bundestag , she documented , in plain sight of  |||  everyone  |||  , how right on target their criticisms are .
neither a tangible  |||  concern  |||  for , nor any sense of the country 's issues could be detected .
instead , she  |||  presented  |||  herself as angela in the sky : a detached politician who takes refuge in foreign affairs , but remains noncommittal even there .
take , for instance , climate protection : she excessively blows her own horn on the resolutions of heiligendamm , but does not share how climate protection objectives are to be  |||  achieved  |||  in this country .
in doing so , she  |||  damages  |||  her reputation as a pragmatist who solves problems , instead of sugar - coating the truth .
but in the realm of angela in the sky , domestic  |||  issues  |||  are of marginal importance .
|||  child  |||  poverty and the worries of low - wage earners ?
it is telling how often she misspeaks when it  |||  comes  |||  to children 's allowance .
at this point in her address , merkel  |||  needs  |||  three attempts to produce a reasonably serviceable sentence .
as soon as things  |||  become  |||  concrete , she stumbles as if on unfamiliar ground .
|||  attack  |||  department
the candidates ' tension is finding release as early as at the first  |||  subject  |||  .
mitt romney accused his opponent rudy giuliani of turning new york into a " safe haven for  |||  illegal  |||  immigrants . "
the candidates mount the attack : because the republican base still lacks a  |||  clear  |||  favourite , the eight presidential contenders use the cnn debate , first and foremost , to discredit their opponents .
the self - made 30 - second videos submitted via youtube by internet  |||  users  |||  contribute little more than cues .
" this is the kind of isolationism which  |||  allowed  |||  hitler to rise to power , " john mccain accuses opponent ron paul , the only one in the group demanding an instant withdrawal from iraq .
however , audience reactions in st. petersburg , florida ,  |||  show  |||  that the important issues of the campaign are far off from the iraq war and the torture debates .
" i was wrong back then , " a remorseful romney announces , apologizing to  |||  base  |||  and audience for having endorsed abortion as recently as in 1994 .
giuliani faltered when asked about his  |||  opinion  |||  on taking the bible literally , meanwhile .
one day after resigning as army chief ,  |||  pakistani  |||  ruler musharraf was sworn in as president .
thus , eight years of  |||  military  |||  rule in pakistan came to an end .
on thursday , president pervez musharraf was sworn in for  |||  another  |||  five - year term in office .
the ceremony at the presidential palace in the capital islamabad was broadcast  |||  live  |||  on pakistani television .
musharraf vowed to honour the constitution and to act towards the good of the  |||  nation  |||  .
on wednesday , he had consigned the office of army chief to his confidant ashfaq kiyani , yielding to international pressure , by the us in  |||  particular  |||  .
eight years after seizing power in a bloodless military coup , the former  |||  general  |||  now for the first time reigns as a civilian head of state .
by stepping down as commander - in - chief of the armed  |||  forces  |||  , musharraf had complied with one of the key demands of the opposition and of the west .
ending the state of  |||  emergency  |||  , which musharraf had declared on november 3 , is another central demand .
according to attorney general malik muhammad qayyum , musharraf will revoke the state of emergency soon after being sworn in , and by doing so  |||  meet  |||  another of the demands of the west .
last week , the country 's supreme court had overruled all objections to the head of state 's controversial re - election on october 6. after declaring a state of  |||  emergency  |||  , musharraf had filled it with jurisprudents who were well - disposed towards him .
in the northern tribal area of north waziristan , four soldiers were  |||  killed  |||  and four more harmed in an attack on a military convoy , meanwhile .
according to an army spokesman , the bomb exploded on a road  |||  near  |||  the afghanistan border .
the fathers of krautrock are  |||  back  |||
germany 's super group of the seventies is reunited : at a concert in berlin , the three band  |||  members  |||  of harmonia once again grabbed their mixing consoles .
at his  |||  left  |||  flank is michael rother , a paltry 57 , wielding a laptop computer and a guitar .
each of them is contributing noises ,  |||  sometimes  |||  even a beat .
the gentlemen themselves do not  |||  seem  |||  overly bothered when it does , either .
the  |||  band  |||  harmonia 's reunion has caused some excitement among krautrock aficionados .
although , it may be disclosed here : specific inquiries uncovered that while the  |||  name  |||  was buzzing through collective pop memory , it was not so forcefully as to have this band being sorely missed for 32 years .
but why should germans not be allowed to celebrate their  |||  living  |||  legends from the seventies , too ?
at shows later on , michael rother sat on  |||  stage  |||  with the red hot chili peppers , like an old pal .
the problem with the  |||  ignorance  |||  at home and a misty - eyed view abroad is one thing .
harmonia overtaxes the brain for the simple reason that the trio existed for two years only , making much less of an impression in that period than  |||  others  |||  would attest in hindsight .
rother had briefly helped out kraftwerk , and had subsequently made a name for himself as a guitarist with neu ! , at the time perhaps the most radical  |||  german  |||  group .
there , at the alte weserhof , an old ruin dating to the 16th century , they lived as communards , away from the  |||  cities  |||  .
less ideologically than at kommune i , where roedelius had  |||  once  |||  laboured as a nanny .
but rather  |||  living  |||  the spitzwegian life of an artist .
|||  allegedly  |||  , a banneret of the glee club harmonia ottenstein was found amid some scrap , and thus , a name for their art .
the first album was called " musik von harmonia , " the  |||  next  |||  one " de luxe . "
the newly released cd " live 1974 " was recorded at a concert in griessem , in front of a  |||  record  |||  audience of 50 , as somebody seems to recall .
cluster became fashionable again in the eighties , and went on to be more successful than harmonia  |||  ever  |||  was .
the griessem  |||  live  |||  album is owed to herbert grönemeyer .
his record label grönland aims to preserve krautrock as germany 's own distinct  |||  contribution  |||  to lively music .
the in - the - flesh resurrection of harmonia takes place at the berlin  |||  house  |||  of cultures of the world .
|||  publicly  |||  funded , as part of the worldtronics festival .
along with the idiosyncratic sound , brian eno 's dictum is hovering in the room : " the only  |||  true  |||  music , the future belongs to it . "
projections of  |||  further  |||  black - and - white photos showing woozily wired machinery do their part in the making of a legend .
in front of it all , the three veterans are  |||  once again  |||  improvising .
krautrock , after all , has always been a very english  |||  term  |||  .
it never was  |||  rock  |||  .
on the  |||  stage  |||  , even the most self - evident things are considered most thoroughly .
where does music  |||  start  |||  , and when does it end ?
it can wreck your  |||  nerves  |||  , or it can grant fleeting moments of great happiness .
richard gere just is n't cynical  |||  enough  |||
" the hunting party " and " mörderischer frieden " make two more films dealing with the  |||  balkan  |||  war .
but neither of them is  |||  convincing  |||  .
even richard gere , in " the hunting  |||  party  |||  , " ca n't change that .
the good news first : war criminals karadzic and mladic may still be hiding in the balkan mountains . but  |||  right  |||  there , of all places , in the dark hinterland of the bosnian war , the actor richard gere has now been recovered .
we had  |||  lost  |||  sight of the most beautiful man of the eighties lately , after all too many nicely trivial roles in feel - good films for women and all too many press conferences on buddhism had exorcised any desire to watch him .
now , suddenly , richard gere is the best reason why we would maybe want to watch " the hunting party , " after all . ( the full german title is " the hunting party -- wenn der jäger zum gejagten wird " - why do film titles always have to be as  |||  long  |||  and dizzying over here as labour agreements for engine drivers ? )
his  |||  performance  |||  is delightfully tongue - in - cheek . essentially , his war reporter simon hunt is who gere could have ended up as , had fate and the film industry not been so kind to him : a man whose heyday is long past , but who has preserved considerable shreds of his former charm even as a ruin - like monument .
still , despite this trump card , " the hunting party , " along with the german production " mörderischer frieden , " which also debuts this week , merely continues the endless line of  |||  failed  |||  balkan war movies .
" mörderischer frieden " can be dealt with fairly quickly : the film is about two german soldiers in kosovo ( adrian topol , max riemelt ) who rescue a serbian woman from kosovan snipers - and one of  |||  whom  |||  promptly falls in love with her , to boot .
what  |||  remains  |||  is something like the german car - chase tv show " alarm für cobra 11 , " only with war taking the place of the autobahn .
" the hunting party , " meanwhile , is kind of like exhibit a in the investigation on why there 's actually never been a really good  |||  balkan  |||  war movie .
with another director and another screenwriter ( richard shepard is both ) , and at another time , the story of three us war reporters committed to track down serbian war  |||  criminal  |||  supreme " the fox " might have ended up becoming a new " apocalypse now . "
the stories , after all , are strikingly  |||  similar  |||  : in both , small teams enter the woods to accomplish something the military could n't , and in both , the result is a journey into madness .
" the hunting party " goes off the rails altogether when the reporters , in fast - forward motion , achieve in the last five minutes what nato , cia and all the bounty hunters in the world have n't been able to achieve in five years : to catch the war criminal and  |||  leave  |||  him to the just revenge of the bosnian muslims .
this is so bad , it makes you want to appeal to the international  |||  court  |||  of justice at the hague on the grounds of crimes against cinematic logic .
the film 's concern , however , is actually a deeply  |||  human  |||  one .
|||  recently  |||  , it was reported in this paper that all hollywood iraq movies have utterly bombed .
one could add : there has never been a good  |||  south africa  |||  movie , either .
some film or other may still mature -- the vietnam works " the deer hunter , " " apocalypse now " or " full metal jacket , " now  |||  considered  |||  to be classics , were not exactly celebrated unanimously as masterworks at the time , after all .
or maybe we just know too much about the violent conflicts of the world nowadays , with every instance of  |||  mass  |||  murder appearing at our homes in real time and on two screens simultaneously .
and that robs screenwriters of the recklessness  |||  required  |||  to tell good stories .
part of the reason why " to be or not to be " or " the great dictator " are such good films , after all , is that lubitsch and chaplin did n't yet know how bad the  |||  nazi  |||  regime 's reign really was .
to be able to make good  |||  films  |||  , perhaps one must not want to be good .
perhaps a sarcastically distanced artistic  |||  view  |||  like the novelist lawrence norfolk 's is required .
queried on the parallels between his  |||  historical  |||  novel " lemprière 's dictionary " and the balkan war , he replied : " that 's just because some things never change .
von beust criticized on  |||  olympics  |||  withdrawal
many intend to  |||  keep  |||  fighting for the waterfront games .
on wednesday , hans - jörg schmidt - trenz , managing director of the hamburg chamber of commerce ,  |||  described  |||  the withdrawal as being " not good for the economic area . "
" without that goal , the current sporting - politics momentum could not be  |||  maintained  |||  to this degree . "
mayor ole von beust insisted on  |||  earlier  |||  statements on wednesday , saying that hamburg 's olympic ambitions were unrealistic , at least before the year 2028 .
" it 's the  |||  german  |||  olympic sports confederation that has to decide on an application for the olympics , not hamburg , " von beust told " welt online . "
" what this preference means for us is that we wo n't have a  |||  realistic  |||  chance in the previously considered period prior to 2028 . "
they created the impression that hamburg did not intend to apply for olympic games for the  |||  next  |||  25 years , it was said .
" it 's premature to spoil our odds by scrapping the plans at such an early stage , " hsb  |||  president  |||  günter ploß said on wednesday .
further , withdrawing from the application was contradictory to statements made by the  |||  head  |||  of senate on the occasion of a reception at a plenary meeting of the german university sports confederation , ploß added .
the university sports confederation had nominated hamburg as a candidate for application as recently as  |||  last  |||  week .
" the senate delayed the development of kleiner grasbrook for years , because it had put all its eggs in the olympics basket and neglected housing  |||  construction  |||  , " said social democratic delegates carola veit and jan quast .
the application for the 2012 summer olympic games had  |||  generated  |||  much excitement in hamburg at the time .
those are n't warhol 's  |||  boxes  |||
connecting the  |||  terms  |||  " sweden " and " wooden box " makes one think of ikea , rather than andy warhol .
|||  currently  |||  , wooden boxes manufactured in sweden are casting dark shadows on warhol 's catalogue of work .
after swedish newspaper " expressen " had cast doubt on the authenticity of andy warhol 's 1968 brillo boxes several months ago , an internal investigation at the moderna museet , stockholm , now comes to a sobering conclusion : the six " brillo boxes " donated to the moderna museet by  |||  former  |||  museum director pontus hultén in 1995 are forgeries -- as , presumably , are the bulk of the nearly hundred further extant brillo boxes of the " type stockholm " in circulation on the international art market .
in 1964 , andy warhol created his first " brillo boxes " in new york : painted  |||  wooden  |||  boxes based on the red , white and blue design of the " brillo " soap cardboard boxes .
they were n't works of art , but their models --  |||  mere  |||  sample pieces .
simultaneously , warhol  |||  apparently  |||  consented to the production of a small number of wooden brillo boxes in sweden in 1968 , which , however , were not exhibited at the moderna museet .
contemporary witnesses now  |||  speak  |||  of approximately fifteen boxes which made art and auction history as original andy warhol brillo boxes with the designation " type stockholm " back then , and rightly so .
the problem , now , is that legendary museum director pontus hultén later falsely claimed that around a hundred wooden boxes were  |||  produced  |||  and exhibited in sweden in 1968 , and subsequently consigned to him by warhol .
as a matter of fact , however , hultén 's 105 boxes were not  |||  produced  |||  until 1990 in malmö , for an exhibition in st. petersburg .
at that point in time , warhol had already been  |||  dead  |||  for three years .
the  |||  structure  |||  of the 1990 facsimiles reveals , however , that the paint was applied directly to the pressboard with a roller and without priming -- and , further , that it was n't oil paint , but acrylic .
" these boxes were not authorized by the artist and should be removed from the official list of andy warhol 's brillo boxes , " says lars nittwe , director of the moderna museet . " unless the andy warhol art authentication board in new york arrives at a  |||  different  |||  conclusion , the moderna museet will classify the six boxes in its collection as facsimiles / sample pieces . "
of course , the authentication  |||  board  |||  had already announced an investigation into the " grave allegations " made in the case of the soapboxes back in july .
however , it has been shrouded in adamant  |||  silence  |||  ever since .
in the phillipines , renegade soldiers surrendered after seizing a hotel in manila and  |||  demanding  |||  the overthrow of president gloria macapagal arroyo .
|||  earlier  |||  , government troops had stormed the hotel using tear gas .
they seized the peninsula hotel ,  |||  demanding  |||  president gloria macapagal arroyo to be overthrown .
troops loyal to the government cordoned off the area  |||  surrounding  |||  the posh hotel .
the president called for an  |||  emergency  |||  meeting of the national security cabinet .
national security adviser norberto gonzales  |||  condemned  |||  the soldiers ' actions .
other military units were to join the march shortly , said  |||  general  |||  danilo lim , former leader of the scout rangers elite unit .

|||  united  |||  internet has secured more than 20 percent of telecommunications company versatel .
|||  options  |||  to increase its holding of versatel were being kept open , the company said .
according to united internet , the move is intended to advance the consolidation of the  |||  german  |||  dsl market .
earlier on wednesday , there had already been speculation about an acquisition of shares after berenberg bank had  |||  increased  |||  its participation in the düsseldorf network operator by another five percent , to 15.1 percent .
the bank was merely  |||  holding  |||  the shares for a third party , rumours in the financial market suggested .
on the previous day , united internet had already bought into  |||  mobile  |||  telecommunications operator drillisch with around ten percent .
in the context of a capital  |||  increase  |||  , drillisch placed 17.4 million in new shares , with a total value of 106.4 million euros .
of those ,  |||  united  |||  internet bought 5.15 million shares at 31.4 million euros total .
further , the companies are in talks over  |||  marketing  |||  cooperations for dsl and mobile telecommunications products .
" we are strengthening our partnership , " a spokesman for  |||  united  |||  internet explained .
for the time being , the two companies will settle for a share of approximately ten percent and not make use of their option to buy  |||  another  |||  18.49 percent of freenet , united internet announced on thursday .
however , the two companies were keeping all their options open , especially with a view to  |||  increasing  |||  their share of freenet ag , it was said .
talks between  |||  united  |||  internet and freenet about a strategic partnership had been aborted in mid - november .
the months - long and at this stage fairly unclear power struggle over freenet is part of the consolidation of the  |||  german  |||  telecommunication market .
the holding of united internet and drillisch has , so far , directly  |||  held  |||  6.01 percent of freenet shares .
now , it had been arranged for drillisch to acquire  |||  another  |||  four percent , it was said .
the option to buy 18.49 percent from  |||  investment  |||  company vatas had already been arranged back in august .
prague stock market falls to minus by the end of the  |||  trading  |||  day
after a sharp drop in the morning , the prague  |||  stock market  |||  corrected its losses .
transactions with stocks from the czech energy enterprise ( čez )  |||  reached  |||  nearly half of the regular daily trading .
this time the fall in  |||  stocks  |||  on wall street is responsible for the drop .
the reaction of the market to the results of the vote in the american house of representatives , which refused to  |||  support  |||  the plan for the stabilization of the financial sector there , has manifested itself here as well .
stocks  |||  fall  |||  in asia
stocks in the asian markets  |||  experienced  |||  a dramatic drop on tuesday , even though the indexes ultimately erased a part of the losses during the day .
the hang seng china enterprises index , which follows the movement of  |||  chinese  |||  stocks on the stock market in hong kong , dropped by 3.8 percent , in shanghai the markets were closed .
the stock exchange in taiwan  |||  dropped  |||  by 3.6 percent according to the local index .
" the timing of the bailout  |||  action  |||  in the usa is uncertain and it will influence financial markets all over the world , " remarked the head of the hong kong currency board , joseph yam .
despite the fact that it is a part of china , hong kong determines its currency policy separately , that is , without being dependent on the  |||  chinese  |||  central bank .
hong kong has  |||  interest  |||  rates at the same level as the united states .
american legislators should quickly return to their negotiations and approve the bill to support the financial system , according to australian  |||  prime minister  |||  kevin rudd .
otherwise there reputedly looms the threat that other countries will also  |||  feel  |||  the impacts .
|||  american  |||  stock bloodbath
on monday the american house of representatives  |||  rejected  |||  the plan to support the financial system , into which up to 700 billion dollars ( nearly 12 billion czech crowns ) was to be invested .
the legislators thus ignored president george bush 's  |||  appeal  |||  for them to support the plan .
american stocks suffered a bloodbath on monday and the major stock indexes registered their greatest  |||  fall  |||  in more than 20 years .
the index had dropped even prior to the vote , but as soon as it was revealed that the bill had not passed in the house , the index went into free  |||  fall  |||  .
congress yields : us  |||  government  |||  can pump 700 billion dollars into banks
the top representatives of the american congress and george w. bush 's cabinet have  |||  agreed  |||  upon a broader form of the agreement on financial assistance for the american financial system .
the vote on it will take place at the beginning of  |||  next  |||  week .
|||  american  |||  legislators made a breakthrough in their talks about the approval of a bailout plan in the form of financial assistance for the american financial system amounting to 700 billion dollars ( approximately 12 billion crowns ) .
that is , the members of congress have to  |||  complete  |||  some details of the agreement before they can make the final version of the law public and vote on it .
the plan to support the financial system will be  |||  discussed  |||  in the house of representatives on monday .
the chair of the financial services committee , barney  |||  frank  |||  , told reuters this on sunday .
sources say that the senate could evidently  |||  vote  |||  on the plan on wednesday at the soonest .
economists say that the announcement that the bailout plan will be approved should be the first psychological factor  |||  significant  |||  to the revival of financial markets .
afterward , however , a " sobering up " will take place due to the complicated nature of the mechanisms with which assistance to the markets can be achieved in  |||  practice  |||  .
paulson : plan must be  |||  effective  |||
" we 've made great  |||  progress  |||  .
we 've resolved our differing opinions on how the package for the stabilization of markets should  |||  look  |||  , " democrat nancy pelosi told bloomberg .
representatives of the legislators met with american finance minister henry paulson saturday night in  |||  order  |||  to give the government fund a final form .
the fund is meant to purchase unsellable mortgage assets which are pulling financial companies down into  |||  heavy  |||  losses and are endangering the stability of the entire system .
" we 're on the edge of a definitive agreement on a plan which will function and which also must be  |||  effective  |||  on the market .
it 's necessary to continue in the curative  |||  plan  |||  , but i think we 're there , " paulson said .
a signal for asian  |||  trading  |||
the global financial crisis is significantly impacting the  |||  stock  |||  markets , which are dropping sharply .
namely , by doing this they want to calm investors prior to  |||  trading  |||  on the asian financial markets , which , given their time zones , are the first ones where the decision by congress could influence monday 's trading .
in the meantime , however , it is not yet  |||  clear  |||  with any certainty when both chambers of the american congress will vote on the bill , nor whether the negotiations will not become hindered by some problem .
the legislators hope that it will be  |||  approved  |||  in the next few days .
however , the bill will still go through a series of  |||  changes  |||  .
the total  |||  amount  |||  designated for assistance to the system is to be divided into two parts .
the initial 350 billion dollars is to become available as soon as possible , as  |||  requested  |||  by president george bush .
but congress can block the release of the remaining amount , in the sequence of a further 100 billion dollars and later , the  |||  final  |||  350 billion dollars , if it has the impression that the program is not fulfilling its function .
|||  bush  |||  appreciates progress in negotiations
|||  though  |||  the president can veto this decision , congress can override his veto .
even in spite of these changes , the  |||  essential  |||  idea of the program , to gain finances for the buyout of bad mortgage stocks , the value of which had dropped because hundreds of thousands of americans were unable to pay off their mortgages , has remained intact .
the  |||  house  |||  of representatives should be able to vote on the bill on sunday and the senate on monday , " said republican senator judd gregg .
even  |||  american  |||  president bush is satisfied with the progress in negotiations .
his speaker tony fratto declared that bush was satisfied with saturday 's progress and appreciated the " two - party effort to stabilize our financial markets and  |||  save  |||  our economy " .
constraining  |||  golden  |||  parachutes
the chairman of the senate banking committee , christopher dodd , the chief negotiator , said that the legislators had  |||  agreed  |||  upon the responsibilities for the financial program , protection of the taxpayers against losses , closing of relief packages , and timing of the financial plan .
" we 've  |||  worked  |||  very hard on this and we 've made great progress toward an agreement that will work and that will be useful for all americans , " paulson said .
the plan also includes assistance to  |||  homeowners  |||  who have problems making their payments .
marek : psychological  |||  help  |||
according to the chief economist of patria finance , david marek , the  |||  proposed  |||  plan is a good idea , but its realization will be very difficult .
" and this is because it is not known through what mechanism and for what  |||  price  |||  the problematic assets will be bought .
this will determine how the financial sector and the cabinet will divide the losses amongst  |||  themselves  |||  , " marek told the server ihned.cz this week .
whether the plan is approved now or at the beginning of next week is not so  |||  significant  |||  , according to marek .
" more important is for the members of congress to  |||  agree  |||  this week to support the plan and to approve it as soon as possible .
the  |||  psychological  |||  significance of the agreement that the approval will take place is the most important thing at this time , " marek emphasized .
our advice on how to  |||  choose  |||
while nearly  |||  every  |||  cell phone can play mp 3 files , no mp 3 player can make phone calls .
in spite of this , there are many reasons to get a  |||  separate  |||  mp 3 player .
the choice depends entirely on the manner of use and demands of the future  |||  owner  |||  .
it is not likely that you will get a top - of - the - line  |||  expensive  |||  record player in order to listen to the newest album by maxim turbulenc .
first of all such  |||  music  |||  products not available on lps , but also , from the qualitative point of view there no objective reason for it .
however , if your shelves are crowded with art rock , jazz , or blues vinyl records , you are likely at  |||  least  |||  dreaming of a record player like that .
it 's the same with  |||  music  |||  on trips , that is , compressed music , simply put , mp 3 music .
there are  |||  price  |||  and qualitative categories here as well .
two extremes , between which there is  |||  enough  |||  space for everyone .
the selection is  |||  broad  |||  .
battery life also  |||  decides  |||
some top - of - the - line music players can do much more than merely  |||  play  |||  music , but also what most cell phones ca n't even do by chance .
no contemporary machine is as  |||  universal  |||  as the telephone .
and when we take smart phones and communication devices , you have a small  |||  computer  |||  in your pocket .
it 's a  |||  small  |||  miracle , as there is no refrigerator that knows how to grill and no television can take pictures .
the universal nature of the cell phone also brings  |||  disadvantages  |||  .
the more  |||  functions  |||  you use on your cell phone , the sooner the indicator on your display will send you running for the charger .
and playing music is one of the biggest  |||  energy  |||  guzzlers .
in this way , music players ( particularly the simplest ones ) are much more  |||  efficient  |||  .
which is why you should count on the fact that inexpensive cell phones will not  |||  play  |||  for more than a few hours .
you wo n't have this problem with mp 3 players , even worse ones last at least 9 straight hours  |||  running  |||  on one charge .
|||  another  |||  problem arises when recording music on the cell phone .
for the music players , with some exceptions ( ipod ) , you do n't need any  |||  special  |||  software .
it 's enough to fill the device with music using the usb from the  |||  computer  |||  .
most cell phones and music players already create a music library by  |||  themselves  |||  , organized according to the artist 's name , album title , genre , or , e.g. , user rating .
some devices only display the tree structure of the directory ,  |||  similar  |||  to windows explorer and some are able to do both ( iriver , samsung , sony , cowon , smart phones with an operating systems ) .
music players  |||  easier  |||  to service , cell phones can do more
if music is above all a background setting for you and if you are only  |||  going  |||  to listen to it for a little while , perhaps in the tram , any cell phone which plays mp 3 is enough .
you do n't even have to pay too much attention to which  |||  music  |||  formats the cell phone or music player can handle .
the mp 3 can handle all of them , and in fact , most of the  |||  music  |||  you will get will be in this very format .
|||  less  |||  common is the appearance of aac ( the format used by the apple company and its ipods ) .
better cell phones , at the same time ,  |||  enable  |||  the purchase of music on - line .
all you have to do to buy a song or album is visit the pages of the given operator ( or  |||  another  |||  provider ) using mobile internet .
unfortunately the offerings from the operators are paltry and are usually limited to fast - growing  |||  radio  |||  hits .
it is generally  |||  assumed  |||  , however , that this very manner of music sales ( whether using gsm , the internet or wireless internet ) will take over the music industry in the future .
whenever you feel like listening to something , you can  |||  reach  |||  for your cell phone in your pocket , while the mp 3 player lies at home , forgotten .
however , it still  |||  depends  |||  on whether you always have headphones or at least the wire hands - free with you .
if not , you can utilize the  |||  integrated  |||  speaker that is in almost all cell phones , but only in a minimum of mp 3 players .
but the greatest advantage of the  |||  music  |||  cell phones for many people is the price .
the least expensive of them regularly  |||  cost  |||  less than three thousand crowns .
for three or  |||  four  |||  thousand crowns , you can get a very decent walkman .
usually , however , you 'll be limited by the absence of output on  |||  ordinary  |||  headphones .
the best and most technically well - equipped telephones , with a 3.5 mm jack for  |||  ordinary  |||  headphones , cost up to fifteen thousand crowns .
anyone can handle the operation of the simplest - not necessarily the most inexpensive ( see our  |||  selection  |||  ) - music players .
even the least expensive cell phones ( e.g. vodafone 527 ) generally have a slot for replaceable  |||  memory  |||  cards ( of the type m 2 , microsd and the like ) .
even with the additional purchase of the  |||  respective  |||  card , you will spend less than two thousand crowns .
with the basic models , only cards with a maximum capacity of 2 gb tend to be  |||  supported  |||  .
based on capacity ( maximum 2 gb ) you do n't have to  |||  spend  |||  more than 1,100 crowns .
these devices have separate control buttons for mp 3 and the user - friendly nature of their operation is  |||  close  |||  to that of a separate mp 3 player .
sony ericsson , whose cell phones from the walkman series have the same user interface as the mp 3 players  |||  sold  |||  separately , is the most advanced in the field .
the mp 3 players from the brands mentioned above deliver the same service and in the same price category up to four thousand crowns , but with a greater memory  |||  capacity  |||  ( up to 16 gb ) and battery endurance ( normally 15 hours , maximally up to 35 hours ) .
first virtual operator to  |||  arrive  |||  in czechia this year .
|||  maybe  |||
in spite of this , there is something missing here - a virtual operator who would force the  |||  classic  |||  operators to lower their prices .
we have already written many times on mobil.cz about the fact that czech  |||  operators  |||  are among the most expensive in europe .
this has also been confirmed by the czech telecommunications bureau , who called attention to the fact that the  |||  price  |||  of a text message is higher here than in the rest of the union .
following the most recent steps taken by the european commission in the field of regulation of the roaming fees , a paradoxical situation may  |||  occur  |||  - text messages for some customers of czech mobile operators will be cheaper from abroad than at home .
the answer is  |||  simple  |||  , there is a lack of competitors who would really like to enter into battle .
|||  perhaps  |||  it sounds paradoxical , after all , we have three mobile networks here and over 100 % coverage .
mobile operators , on the other hand , like to pretend that the czech market is extremely  |||  competitive  |||  .
this is often seconded by the chairman of the council of the czech telecommunications bureau ( ctb ) pavel dvořák , who in the past has claimed several times that there is no room for  |||  another  |||  operator in czechia .
but there is one more opportunity - a virtual  |||  operator  |||  .
it is precisely the entrance of the virtual operators on the mobile market that brought the  |||  significant  |||  lowering of prices , to which even the classic operators had to react .
at the same time , even before the entrance on the market of aggressive competitors such as tesco mobile or virgin mobile , voices  |||  similar  |||  to those here could be heard .
but it has turned out that there is a place for such operators and they can be truly  |||  successful  |||  .
for that matter , we do n't have to go far to find  |||  examples  |||  .
in february of this year , we informed you of the  |||  start  |||  of the virtual operator mobilking in poland .
over the course of merely half a year , this operator was able to gain more than 100 thousand customers and  |||  become  |||  the fifth largest operator .
at the same time , the financial group penta , which owns , among  |||  others  |||  , u:fon , stands behind mobilking .
the advantage of the virtual operators is the opportunity to concentrate on a much more  |||  specific  |||  target group .
in  |||  order  |||  to function effectively , they require many fewer customers than a classic operator does .
that is , they do not carry the relatively  |||  high  |||  costs of construction , operation and maintenance of a mobile network .
that 's how , for example , tesco mobile in great britain can offer text messaging for at least fifty percent less than its  |||  competitors  |||  .
but as the example of mobilking in poland shows , it can be a rather good move and a bet on a novel  |||  target  |||  group .
that is , this  |||  operator  |||  is specifically oriented toward men .
" real men  |||  choose  |||  mobilking - the operator that they like and can trust , " says david seibert , the ceo of mobile entertainment company , which runs this virtual operator .
it is hard to say if a concept similar to the one in poland could  |||  catch  |||  on here .
miroslav čepický , spokesman for vodafone , doubts this : " the czech market is relatively small for the segmented approach on which most virtual  |||  operators  |||  are founded .
in addition , it 's relatively saturated from the perspective of the  |||  offer  |||  of services . "
no chance in czechia , say mobile  |||  operators  |||
it seems almost  |||  certain  |||  that if there is to be a virtual operator in czechia , it wo n't be mobilking .
" we have been  |||  talking  |||  about the expansion of this successful project , but the negotiations in czechia do n't look very hopeful .
more likely , mobilking will be  |||  launched  |||  in other countries in our region , " said jana studničková , speaker for the penta financial group , in a telephone interview for mobil.cz .
she also confirmed indirectly that the  |||  current  |||  mobile operators in czechia are definitely not inclined toward this idea .
rather , on the contrary , they are  |||  trying  |||  to do everything they can so that no potential competitor comes into existence .
for a longer period of time now , the gts novera group has made no secret of its interest in launching a virtual mobile operator , and in this way it would like to take another step in the direction of becoming a  |||  real  |||  competitor of telefonica o 2 in the area of corporate clientele .
" we are very interested in being able to  |||  offer  |||  our customers not only hardwire telecommunication services , but also mobile ones .
the sooner , the  |||  better  |||  .
we have held  |||  repeated  |||  negotiations on this possibility with all czech mobile operators .
we have already been able to make  |||  progress  |||  in the negotiations with some of them , " said the group 's spokesman , pavel kaidl .
in the meantime , however , its  |||  creation  |||  is accompanied by a wall of silence .
" at this time , we do not think that there is  |||  space  |||  for the creation of a full - fledged virtual operator .
compared to other markets , the czech market is very  |||  specific  |||  .
no subject has approached us thus far with a complex and  |||  serious  |||  project in this area , " claimed vlastimil sršeň from the public relations department of telefonica 02 in a statement for mobil.cz .
vodafone is placing its attention more upon fulfilling the requirements of its own 3g  |||  license  |||  .
regarding this , miroslav čepický said : " we are open to negotiations with potential virtual operators , above all in the area of  |||  shared  |||  costs and infrastructure .
from the  |||  perspective  |||  of the customers , we consider this to be the most beneficial .
vodafone 's main strategy in this area is to find a partner for the construction of a  |||  shared  |||  network for fast mobile internet . "
|||  responsible  |||  authorities - buddy - buddy with operators
the procedure of the mobile operators is easy to understand , the entrance of another operator would mean  |||  increased  |||  competition , it would lead to a decrease in prices and hence to a decrease in their profits .
probably the greatest pressure on the czech telecommunication office was during the time of the creation of u:fon by t -  |||  mobile  |||  .
but now this is a suitable argument for u:fon to not allow the entrance of the virtual  |||  operator  |||  .
regarding that matter , martina kemrová pointed out : " the  |||  competitive  |||  environment of the mobile market was also recently amplified by the entrance of the fourth mobile operator onto the market .
|||  considering  |||  the character of the mobile market in the czech republic , it is evident that the entrance of another player would place higher demands on it and above all on its services . "
but  |||  considering  |||  this approach by the mobile operators , the lack of interest by the czech regulatory organs is , in fact , startling .
this means not only the attitude of the cto , which unfortunately in czechia - unlike in great britain and other  |||  developed  |||  countries - does not have the authority to intervene in economic competition .
this authority belongs to the office for the protection of  |||  competition  |||  ( opc ) exclusively .
but this office has assumed its typical position on this whole  |||  issue  |||  .
" the entrance of a virtual operator on the mobile market would be possible after the signing of a contract on the rental of the  |||  necessary  |||  infrastructure between the mobile operator and the virtual operator .
no such contract has ever been signed , because the  |||  supply  |||  of potential interested parties was most likely not sufficiently interesting for classic operators , " claimed kristián chalupa from the external relations department of the opc in his answer to our question .
a statement  |||  formulated  |||  in that way by representatives of the operators probably wo n't surprise anyone .
from the office that is supposed to represent the interests of consumers and , among other things , make sure that no one abuses his / her  |||  position  |||  on the market , it is more than serious .
but evidently the pressure on the  |||  proper  |||  functioning of the market environment and the decrease in prices are not among the interests of the opc .
in truth , the shocking element of the whole case is the almost fluid harmony between the three mobile  |||  operators  |||  that is implicit in their reactions .
the question as to whether this is really just a coincidence arises  |||  entirely  |||  by itself .
" the office did not find any  |||  signs  |||  of actions violating the rules of competition , and thus has no reason to intervene in any way .
none of the operators have a dominant position , and hence none of them have the corresponding  |||  increased  |||  responsibility for their actions on the market .
the telecommunications regulator is most likely also lacking the instruments necessary to  |||  open  |||  the mobile market for the virtual operators , " chalupa claimed in his statement .
the interpretation of the dominant  |||  position  |||  on the market is one of the disputed points .
of course , an analysis of the  |||  relevant  |||  markets does exist , conducted by cto , according to which telecommunications are , from the perspective of competition , the only market .
on such a market , none of the czech operators then have a dominant  |||  position  |||  .
but some legal experts offer a  |||  different  |||  perspective - in order to create a virtual operator , it is always necessary to gain the permission of the network operator .
and the mobile  |||  operator  |||  - entirely logically - has a monopoly on its network .
so in a certain segment , it must necessarily be  |||  dominant  |||  .
but even if we did not consider this argument , for the opc it could be at least alarming that the three mobile  |||  operators  |||  are proceeding in a strikingly similar manner .
at the same time , complaints from a series of interested parties ( including the gts novera company mentioned above )  |||  demonstrate  |||  that they are encountering very similar hurdles in their negotiations with all the operators .
placing the responsibility on the cto is a rather common trick in telecommunications , through which the opc can have nothing to do with the whole  |||  matter  |||  .
we have already encountered it in several  |||  similar  |||  cases .
the representatives of the opc must know this very well , but their interests are evidently  |||  elsewhere  |||  .
at the same time , the functioning of some pseudo - virtual operators , of which there are already several in  |||  czech  |||  mobile networks , remains unnoticed .
these are companies which publish their own price lists for mobile telephone services , which are only partially  |||  public  |||  .
these are usually companies dealing with multilevel  |||  marketing  |||  .
for example , amway , bohemia telecom , starlife and a number of others  |||  offer  |||  their own mobile telephone services .
the price lists of these  |||  companies  |||  usually only reach selected individuals .
the trick lies in the fact that , in relation to the operator , the company  |||  acts  |||  like a classic company client who orders a great amount of sim cards .
as a  |||  significant  |||  client , it then gets special price offers ( and other types of offers ) .
the problem is that the trading conditions of all czech mobile  |||  operators  |||  prohibit such advance sales .
but it is highly unlikely that activities like this would not be reported to the  |||  responsible  |||  people from the mobile operators .
this could be a question of thousands of customers , above all in the case of the three  |||  companies  |||  mentioned above .
but at the same time , none of the  |||  operators  |||  are opposed to such a procedure .
namely , they make considerable profits from the activities of these companies and at the same time - unlike the  |||  real  |||  virtual operators - they do not present any sort of threat to them through their own official marketing .
miroslav čepický draws attention to  |||  potential  |||  problems : " the law enables such speculation , nevertheless only an insignificant percentage of customers use the services of these companies .
on top of that , they must  |||  accept  |||  that the sim card in their telephone is not registered under their name , and thus they cannot use all of its features like the regular customers of the mobile operators can . "
this is precisely what should seem at least  |||  strange  |||  to the cto .
in addition ,  |||  another  |||  question for the opc arises .
if the mobile  |||  operators  |||  are looking the other way concerning this procedure , why are they blocking the creation of a virtual operator ?
at the same time , classical operators have more or less tried to  |||  prevent  |||  the creation of virtual operators practically in all countries where they have been created .
the arguments they used were practically identical - a market that was too  |||  small  |||  , too saturated , problems with the quality of services , etc.
but in  |||  developed  |||  countries , the regulatory organs , which supported the interests not of the mobile operators , but of their customers , intervened at that very moment .
either through formal measures or informal pressure , they then achieved the creation of the first virtual operator , and  |||  others  |||  continued in its footsteps .
unfortunately , the czech  |||  regulatory  |||  organs have been tossing the whole case back and forth like a hot potato .
if the behind - the - scenes information are correct and a virtual operator appears here soon , the czech mobile market  |||  might  |||  be set in motion once again .
if one of the operators permits the creation of a virtual mobile operator , it will be difficult for opc to be able to  |||  remain  |||  indifferent to the refusal ( discrimination ) of further interested parties .
and we might stop making calls that are more expensive than in the rest of  |||  europe  |||  .
new  |||  czech  |||  national anthem has four new versions .
|||  choose  |||  the best one
listen to the four renderings of the new version of the czech  |||  national  |||  anthem .
on sunday prime minister mirek topolánek  |||  presented  |||  the new recordings of the national anthem kde domov můj ( where is my country ) on the occasion of the day of czech statehood .
the anthem was newly recorded by the  |||  national  |||  theater orchestra under the direction of jiří bělohlávek .
kateřina kněžínková and  |||  adam  |||  plachetka did the singing .
you can  |||  listen  |||  to all four versions on the server ihned.cz .
he told czech radio earlier that he had intentionally selected singers with young , representative voices that were striking and  |||  popular  |||  for the solo variants .
" from the beginning , with both of them and also with the chorus , i tried to make sure that they had clear articulation , so that the text could be  |||  understood  |||  well , so that they were in harmony , " he said .
the czech  |||  national  |||  anthem will celebrate its 175th anniversary next year .
the song kde domov můj ( where is my country ) was heard for the first time in 1834 on the stage of the estates theater in the original czech  |||  play  |||  fidlovačka by josef kajetán tyl with the music of františek škroup .
it gained popularity and the people spontaneously  |||  took  |||  it as their own .
the first stanza of the song then became a natural part of the  |||  national  |||  anthem following the creation of czechoslovakia in 1918 .
it  |||  remained  |||  one of the seven state symbols even following the creation of the independent czech republic .
the roughly one  |||  hundred  |||  thousand people in possession of their own chip card opencard at this time can get this coupon .
travellers can buy a 30 - day , 90 - day and year - long coupon ( which will be  |||  valid  |||  beginning on january 1 , 2009 ) and at the same time have it added to their chip card at info centers and branches of the transport company at the metro stations muzeum , můstek , nádraží holešovice , anděl , roztyly , letňany , kobylisy , rajská zahrada , kačerov and luka .
beginning yesterday , coupons can also be purchased over the internet on the web pages of the  |||  transport  |||  company , www.dpp.cz .
by the afternoon , more than four hundred  |||  customers  |||  had used the service .
they are red , resembling ticket validation machines , and travellers  |||  might  |||  have already noticed them in the metro stations roztyly , budějovická , i. p. pavlova , florenc and vltavská .
" now there are five of them in the city , but by the end of the year there should be eighty of them , " opatrný  |||  added  |||  .
coupon checked by self - service machine instead of  |||  driver  |||
using the self - service machines , which will  |||  begin  |||  functioning tomorrow , is simple .
the electronic coupons are  |||  valid  |||  beginning tomorrow not only in the capital city , but in its surroundings as well .
upon boarding , it is thus necessary to not only  |||  show  |||  the chip card to the driver , but in addition it is necessary to place the opencard on the designated spot on the side of the cash register .
this is how the driver checks the validity of the coupons  |||  recorded  |||  .
" if the traveller needs to confirm the validity of the coupons  |||  recorded  |||  , there is nothing easier than requesting this information from the driver , " drápal added .
travelers who do not use suburban buses , and will not  |||  remember  |||  when the validity of a coupon ends , can head again for the self - service machines where the coupons are added to the card .
sudetenlands  |||  wanted  |||  referendum from usa
sudeten germans  |||  requested  |||  that the šumava region be incorporated into the united states in 1945 .
if we cannot be a part of germany or austria , we wish at least to  |||  live  |||  under the patronage of the united states .
several groups of sudeten germans supposedly addressed the president of the usa with a  |||  wish  |||  of this type .
this arises from , among other things , a letter which has been preserved in a  |||  private  |||  archive and is now stored in the collections of the south bohemia research library .
in the letter , germans from český krumlov request that the american president not to allow the  |||  return  |||  of the " šumava region " - occupied by hitler on the basis of the munich agreement - to czechoslovakia .
" we have  |||  understood  |||  the situation correctly and we want to be truly certain of the words that the american troops are entering german territory not as oppressors and enemies , but rather , as liberators , " is what is written in the letter , signed " people who are not indifferent to the fate of šumava " .
since the annexation by czechoslovakia supposedly only gives the sudeten germans hope for - knowing the czech national character - brutality , disregard , lack of understanding , oppression and slavery , the authors of the letter ask the  |||  american  |||  president to take over the protectorate of šumava forever .
" we cannot  |||  believe  |||  that without considering the opinion of a quarter of a million people , you would award this territory to a state foreign to us , which oppresses and oppugns minorities and which has contributed nothing , absolutely nothing , to the victory of the allies , " is written in the letter .
the reason why the authors could not  |||  sign  |||  their names was the supposed fear of revenge by the " czech oppressors " .
if the president of the usa were to supposedly have doubts about the persuasion of the šumava germans , it would be enough to organize a referendum in the šumava region on whether its inhabitants want to  |||  become  |||  a part of the usa or live under the patronage of the united states .
though the text of the letter may  |||  sound  |||  a bit naïve given the contemporary knowledge of post - war history , according to some witnesses it appropriately sketches the expectations of the sudeten germans at that time .
even  |||  though  |||  the czech germans had to at least suspect that their displacement from the country would be discussed , almost none of them admitted this possibility at all .
some expected that the united states and great britain would negotiate a  |||  certain  |||  type of autonomy for the sudetenlands .
|||  others  |||  believed that they would simply remain in czechoslovakia .
the  |||  famous  |||  journalist gustav chalupa , born in české budějovice , also confirms this .
as a  |||  german  |||  from české budějovice , he was sent to the navy in the baltic sea during the war .
" they believed that when they returned  |||  home  |||  , czech would come in handy , " chalupa said .
according to him , none of the german prisoners  |||  living  |||  in czechoslovakia before the war envisaged being displaced from the republic on the basis of the beneš decrees .
emotive campaign attacks  |||  drivers  |||
the most expensive  |||  action  |||  aimed at safety on the roads in czech history .
that 's also one way to characterize the emotive  |||  media  |||  campaign which the ministry of transportation plans to launch on wednesday .
the office of  |||  minister  |||  aleš řebíček hopes that it will discourage drivers from behaving dangerously behind the wheel .
the 150 - million - crown campaign will  |||  appear  |||  on television , on the radio , in cinemas , on the internet , but also on flyers .
it should discourage drivers from speeding and  |||  driving  |||  under the influence of alcohol .
and also remind them to fasten their seatbelts  |||  before  |||  they start driving .
above all , it aims to reach into the conscience of young drivers , motorcyclists , pedestrians , and last but not least ,  |||  professional  |||  drivers .
mainly  |||  human  |||  stories that attack the emotions .
and even the "  |||  bloody  |||  " slogan of the whole campaign attests to this :
the words " you do n't think " are  |||  written  |||  in capital letters on a license plate .
this is meant to symbolize that a person can pay for a moment of carelessness with his / her own  |||  life  |||  .
the spots will " haunt " the viewers  |||  until  |||  2010 .
the ministry found inspiration in  |||  similar  |||  campaigns in anglo - saxon countries , where it is common to find pictures with drastic images of accident victims .
sugar and whip for  |||  drivers  |||
" the  |||  drivers  |||  are influenced by the sugar and whip system .
the sugar for them is , for example , when they run a red light , they  |||  save  |||  time .
the whip is the threat of a  |||  fine  |||  or an accident .
the drivers must be repeatedly reminded of the  |||  risk  |||  , " says martin kořán , a transportation psychologist from na homolce hospital .
and that 's why information campaigns in the press and mainly negative advertising are  |||  necessary  |||  , the psychologist believes .
less  |||  effective  |||  in his opinion are the tables which draw the drivers ' attention to the danger .
" if a static table which warns against danger is  |||  installed  |||  , it will likely soon blend in with the surroundings and the drivers will not pay attention to it , " kořán warned .
olmert would  |||  return  |||  nearly all occupied territories in exchange for peace
the prime minister of the provisional israeli government , ehud olmert ,  |||  expressed  |||  his opinion in favour of the restitution of practically all territories occupied in 1967 , that is , even transjordan , east jerusalem and the golan heights , in exchange for peace with the palestinians and with syria .
he did this in an  |||  interview  |||  which was printed by the daily newspaper yedioth ahronoth on monday .
" we must reach an agreement with the palestinians , which means that it will be  |||  necessary  |||  to return nearly all of the ( occupied ) territories , if not all of them , " olmert told the newspaper .
" we will keep a  |||  certain  |||  percentage of these territories , but we will have to cede a similar percentage ( of israeli territory ) to the palestinians , because there will be no peace if we do n't do that , " he added .
he admitted that the possible restitution would also  |||  include  |||  east jerusalem .
" whoever wants to be safe in jerusalem and above all does not want tractors or bulldozers to run over his or her legs , like what happened to one of my best friends , will have to give up a part of jerusalem , " olmert  |||  noted  |||  in reference to two attacks in the city in july , during which several people were killed and tens injured .
according to the  |||  prime minister  |||  , it will be necessary to find a " special solution for the temple mount , a sacred and historic place " , which lies inside the old city .
" whoever will want to  |||  maintain  |||  israeli sovereignty over the whole city will have to integrate 270,000 arabs .
that wo n't work , " he  |||  stressed  |||  further .
olmert also  |||  expressed  |||  his opinion in favour of the withdrawal of israel from the golan heights , which according to him is an essential condition for entering into a peace agreement with syria .
but that would also require  |||  certain  |||  effort from damascus .
" the syrians know well what they will have to give up in  |||  order  |||  to gain the golan heights .
they will have to give up their current relationship with iran ; they will have to give up their relationship to the ( shi - ite movement ) hezbollah ; they will have to give up the ongoing support they  |||  provide  |||  to the terrorism of the ( shi - ite movement ) hamas , ( the terrorist network ) al-qaeda and the jihad ( holy war ) in iraq , " the prime minister specified .
questions after accident : are stewards in the bus  |||  illegal  |||  ?
in connection with the tragic accident of a bus of the company student agency  |||  near  |||  padua , italy , the question has arisen as to whether stewards and passengers can move around the bus while it is in motion .
" if we would like to strictly and formally uphold the law , the activities of the steward are in conflict with the traffic law , " says speaker for the ministry of  |||  transportation  |||  karel hanzelka .
the accident , during which a twenty - two - year - old stewardess died  |||  last  |||  week , was evidently caused by the driver of the truck that crossed into the path of the bus .
unluckily , at that  |||  moment  |||  , the girl was sitting next to the driver , in the least safe place in the vehicle , even though there are two more seats reserved for her .
if this is not approved in the bus , the  |||  passengers  |||  must sit .
" we tried to find a solution to this with the ministry , and  |||  initially  |||  they did not permit the movement of the passengers .
eventually they revoked this and we reached the conclusion that the passengers are allowed to go to the toilet if they have their own seat , " he conveyed his  |||  position  |||  .
however , nor do any legal enactments prohibit the transporters from  |||  providing  |||  services .
the traffic law only knows the  |||  term  |||  vehicle conductor ; it does not define the rights and responsibilities of that person , " speaker hanzelka added less unambiguously .
the head of the department of motor vehicle operation of the ministry of transportation , josef pokorný , on the contrary , said that the law treats this  |||  issue  |||  sufficiently .
" it depends on whether the bus has standing room  |||  permitted  |||  in its certification .
buses are divided into the categories of city bus , where there is standing room and  |||  limited  |||  maximum speed , inter - city buses with standing room and a higher maximum speed permitted , and coach buses , with no standing room and the highest permitted speed and seats equipped with seat belts .
like in an airplane , says  |||  expert  |||
jaroslav hořín , an expert on traffic safety for the national strategy for traffic safety ( besip ) , does not see any  |||  essential  |||  problem in the movement of stewards on the buses .
even there it is not  |||  certain  |||  when turbulence will occur and the stewardess can hit her head . "
" however , if the bus were to brake sharply , of course , the laws of physics are  |||  valid  |||  .
the transport provider must deal with the safety of the stewards through internal regulations , " he says , and he also thinks that from the legal perspective , this  |||  issue  |||  is unresolved .
jančura willing to discontinue  |||  services  |||
student agency is the only bus transport provider to  |||  offer  |||  the steward service .
" but as soon as i gain the impression that the stewards ' job is  |||  risky  |||  , i will discontinue them .
passengers can get  |||  coffee  |||  and newspapers when boarding .
it would also  |||  save  |||  costs , " he says .
alexej litvin , head of asiana , which operates a fraction of the bus  |||  lines  |||  that sa does , explained the absence of stewards in his vehicles as due to safety interests .
a young stewardess from the pilsen area , who had  |||  worked  |||  for the company for two years , died in an accident on the bus line to naples .
the bus driver tried to  |||  avoid  |||  it using a sharp manoeuvre , however , the front right part of the bus grazed it .
jančura rebuffs the claim that the two seats reserved for the stewards '  |||  rest  |||  had been sold out .
" it is not possible to reserve these seats in the coach buses , they are  |||  blocked  |||  . "
the company plans to sue the  |||  driver  |||  of the truck .
the agency will not wait for the court verdict to compensate the girl 's family , but it expects financial  |||  compensation  |||  from the guilty party .
an adaptation of the law , on which a thirty - member expert group from the ministry of transportation has been  |||  working  |||  for over a year , could bring about the specification of the movement of stewards on board the buses .
" but no concrete  |||  conclusion  |||  has been reached .
they are not dealing with buses much , it is more the point system , the maximum speed on the highway and the use of cell phones while driving , " says  |||  expert  |||  hořín .
duesseldorf  |||  hopes  |||  rest in frankfurt
in a letter from the westlb board of directors to the  |||  bank  |||  's employees , grand talk is not in short supply .
combining units of the duesseldorf institution with frankfurt 's deka bank , the notice made public on monday claims , could '  |||  create  |||  a major capital - market institution of the sparkassen finanzgruppe . '
generally , the letter suggests , this kind of jointer might provide the pivotal impulse for  |||  further  |||  concentration in the area of the german state banks , the landesbanken .
that 's what it sounds like when a board of directors wants to  |||  demonstrate  |||  being on top of things in difficult times .
but talks of some type of jointer between deka bank , which savings bank clients are familiar with due to its investment  |||  funds  |||  , and westlb have been making the rounds for some time now - even in frankfurt .
but the administrative board of deka , which is owned in equal parts by the landesbanken and the savings banks associations , has asked the board of directors to commence talks with westlb on joint  |||  business  |||  ventures .
the possible subject is the capital - market business , or  |||  parts  |||  of it .
of course , as sources in the financial community point out , negotiations have only just  |||  begun  |||  .
in 2003 , a merger of deka bank with landesbank rhineland - palatinate and helaba briefly  |||  seemed  |||  to be within the realm of possibility .
as soon as the plans became  |||  public  |||  , the hessian state government spoke out against the participation of helaba .
|||  instead  |||  , landesbank rhineland - palatinate was bought by stuttgart 's landesbank baden - wuerttemberg .
this aside , there  |||  seems  |||  to be an increasing awareness that a consolidation of the various institutions in the public sector is imperative .
first up , now that the state elections in bavaria are over , a jointer between bayernlb and the landesbank baden - wuerttemberg may have  |||  become  |||  more likely .
for helaba , that 's not necessarily good  |||  news  |||  .
should the pressure for more mergers  |||  increase  |||  , it will by degrees be running out of potential partners .
in the south , it would merely be a junior partner , although it has to  |||  date  |||  weathered the financial crisis much better than the institutions in munich and stuttgart .
a merger with westlb , in turn , was squashed  |||  early  |||  this year by the savings bank association of hesse and thuringia , which owns 85 percent of helaba .
but such  |||  geostrategic  |||  considerations are only one side of the equation .
on the other stands the question in how far the institutions ' different  |||  business  |||  models are compatible with another .
in june , merl said that the key issue of finding an appropriate  |||  business  |||  model to ensure the sustainability of the landesbanken had not yet been resolved by the german savings bank association .
ultimately , westlb might also be split up , although , of  |||  course  |||  , that 's not a solution favored at westlb .
the letter from its board of directors , accordingly , voices the manifest desire for a '  |||  comprehensive  |||  solution . '
quite how this is reconcilable with a jointer between  |||  individual  |||  units of westlb and deka bank remains to be seen .
second weekend at the ' wiesn ' is  |||  known  |||  as ' italian weekend '
behind them , next to a five - litre keg of kaiser beer , stands a massively built bearded man who is proving to the approximately 200 oktoberfest tourists just how deep the sounds are that his throat his  |||  capable  |||  of producing .
from here , a parking lot for buses next to the railroad station puorta nuova ,  |||  four  |||  buses will depart at 11:45 tonight , ' destinazione monaco , festa della birra . ' estimated time of arrival : 6:30 am.
three buses are reserved for  |||  italians  |||  mainly , one is exclusively for brazilians .
and very loudly , too ,  |||  says  |||  marco guarda - too loudly for italians .
marco , who wears a  |||  long  |||  coat with fake fur lining and glasses with broad silver earpieces , owns the buses .
they have been making trips to the oktoberfest for five years now , three of them this year  |||  alone  |||  .
staying over night would only generate  |||  unnecessary  |||  costs , marco says .
the trip is 75 euros , including a welcoming round of kaiser beer , brewed according to the bavarian purity law , health insurance , as well as a  |||  german  |||  - language guide - marco enrolled in a language course in frankfurt .
and with no further ado , the buses head out into the  |||  night  |||  , on the autostrada leading to ' brennero . '
there is no  |||  beer  |||  to be had yet .
|||  soon  |||  all is quiet in the bus , the travelers are asleep .
when marco 's group finally arrives , as  |||  planned  |||  , at half past six in the morning at a parking lot near theresienwiese , about 50 other buses from all over europe are already there .
elena , luca and the  |||  others  |||  gather . marco addresses them one last time to give them their marching orders .
first up : put on the  |||  yellow  |||  caps .
on the  |||  left  |||  side , they say ' oktoberfest ' in gothic type , next to the internet address of marco 's travel agency , " conoscersiviaggiando . it " .
second : ' when the doors of the beer tent  |||  open  |||  , you have to run ! ' marco shouts into the morning .
' not in the front , or else we will block the entry . and not all  |||  yellow  |||  hats at the same tables - spread out in the room ! '
it 's 8.25  |||  euros  |||  per ' maß , ' marco screams .
'  |||  show  |||  the security people that we behave !
they want to be  |||  prepared  |||  for the retreat .
there are no exact figures ; estimates say that around 50,000 make their way  |||  across  |||  the alps to descent on the beer tents - ten percent of all visitors on this weekend are said to have arrived from italy specifically for this purpose .
munich 's police are reinforced by seven policemen from south tyrol , and italian volunteers are lending support to the bavarian red cross , according to whose statistics on nationals the italians are  |||  leading  |||  the medical - attention field with about 200 cases , with austrians ( about 80 cases ) and britons ( about 60 cases ) coming in second and third .
italians are  |||  especially  |||  fond of the ' hofbräu ' tent .
no sleep for hypo  |||  real  |||  estate creditors
as recently as  |||  last  |||  week , german finance minister peer steinbrueck stressed that the banking system of germany was relatively stable .
it 's a good thing that the politician used the term ' relatively , ' further interjecting that the  |||  german  |||  banking sector would n't be spared by the crisis .
the real - estate bank hypo  |||  real  |||  estate ( hre ) from munich , which is listed in the dax stock index , is receiving credits in the billions from a consortium of german banks in order to be shielded against the market turbulences .
an individual close to the proceedings  |||  told  |||  reuters on monday that the credit line could be as high as 35 billion euros total .
hypo  |||  real  |||  estate was only required to pay interest on the sum it ends up using , they said .
the money was  |||  coming  |||  from private as well as public banks , they added .
in the first half - year of 2008 , the bank 's cash reserve had shrunk by 95 percent to 2.37 euros , with the  |||  capital  |||  resource quota also slightly declining from 1.6 to 1.45 percent .
the ongoing earnings and net earnings from financial transactions had fallen to nil compared to the same period in the previous year , while earnings from write - ups on demands and specific bonds as well as from the liquidation of accruals from  |||  credit  |||  transactions had shrunk by more than 70 percent to 5 million euros .
the decline in earnings remained at a moderate 16 percent only thanks to higher earnings through refunds from downstream accounting costs from restructuring the former depfa group , as well as from refunds of interest according to the fiscal  |||  code  |||  and from agency for group companies .
because earnings in classical government - funding were slim , depfa had diversified internationally , increasingly engaging in infrastructure projects and in the funding of  |||  joint  |||  ventures between private investors and the government ( public - private partnership , ppp ) .
now hypo real estate has to induce write - offs according to the subsidiary 's worth that will have a '  |||  significant  |||  , material effect ' on the group 's profit - and - loss statement , it said rather vaguely .
since the acquisition of depfa , hypo  |||  real  |||  estate has been a significant financer of government and infrastructure .
because it does not have client deposits , it is more  |||  dependent  |||  on refinancing at the interbank market than other banks .
with the collapse two weeks ago of  |||  american  |||  investment bank lehman brothers , the extension of loans among banks has largely dried up again , because banks are hoarding their assets .
for part of depfa 's loan portfolio - approximately 50 billion euros - hypo  |||  real  |||  estate annually requires short - term capital for refinancing .
according to hypo  |||  real  |||  estate , the credits meet the group 's financing requirements for the foreseeable future , shielding the corporation from ' the influence of the currently largely incapacitated international financial markets . '
hre chairman of the board georg funke said that , in the foreseeable future , the hypo  |||  real  |||  estate group would not have to draw upon the financial markets again , however .
the deutsche bundesbank and the federal institute for financial services supervision ( bafin ) are now considering the hypo  |||  real  |||  estate group 's marketability to be secured .
after the bank was reportedly close to insolvent late sunday night , even a bailout , temporary as it is , is  |||  incapable  |||  of easing people 's minds .
the price per  |||  share  |||  is dropping by 75 percent to 3.30 euros .
to date , hypo  |||  real  |||  estate bonds seemed to be an alternative for speculative investment . after the financial crisis , as well as the bank 's own homemade crisis caused by the acquisition of depfa , however , their recoverability has to be considered dependent on the stability of the international financial system .
as long as central banks , governments and less stricken corporate banks are still willing to  |||  support  |||  the system , bond settlement deadlines can be met .
alternatively , that which nobody dares to hope for yet right now comes to pass , and the financial crisis will be overcome within the  |||  next  |||  15 months .
but  |||  considering  |||  that one report of partial nationalization is chasing the next , a probability bordering on certainty has now shrunk to a valid hope .
this may be causing some sleepless nights for long - term creditors in  |||  particular  |||  , as they ponder the question whether or not to abandon their exposure .
short - term investors may at least use the  |||  line  |||  that has been drawn as an opportunity to draft a loss carry - forward for the capital gains compensation tax payments of the years to come .
when sylvana hiltrop , 16 years old , is asked to introduce herself on her first day at tachibana high school , the girls  |||  begin  |||  to giggle : the german girl is totally ' kawaii ' !
what this  |||  means  |||  ?
' first day at school in  |||  japan  |||  .
the way to  |||  school  |||  alone gave me the jitters .
students begin trickling in at eight o'clock , until a brief conference with the teacher , the '  |||  home  |||  room , ' starts at 8:40 .
but before class  |||  began  |||  , it was my turn to introduce myself .
i 'm not someone who likes to  |||  talk  |||  in front of other people , mind you , let alone a class of 40 .
because i did n't have a  |||  school  |||  uniform yet , i was dressed in one of my host mother 's old skirts , as well as a blouse , blue stockings and black leather shoes .
in this attire , i stood before the desk and tried to pronounce everything correctly : ' sayonara wo she sylvana ... ' - my  |||  name  |||  is sylvana , i 'm from germany and my birthday is a week from now .
at that  |||  moment  |||  , i was very glad that i 'd been learning the language for two years already .
i already  |||  knew  |||  it from my manga .
it 's part of the  |||  essential  |||  vocabulary of japanese girls and means ' cute , ' ' sweet . '
then i scurried to my  |||  seat  |||  .
they were talking all at once and giggled and bombarded me with one question after another , even though japanese english is really hard to  |||  understand  |||  .
my host mother had prepared such a lunch box for me , too - it 's something else than the bleak  |||  german  |||  lunch break sandwiches .
i had rice with herbs ,  |||  little  |||  sausages , salad made from cucumber and algae , fruit and some kind of meat in a tofu coat .
at japanese schools , the bentos are n't just  |||  lunch  |||  .
sometimes it  |||  happens  |||  that a girl gives a homemade bento that she 's fixed in a particularly fancy way to a boy , in the hope of getting to know him better during lunch break .
i  |||  read  |||  about that in my manga .
i 'm looking forward to finding out  |||  whether  |||  that 's happening here , too .
and i always  |||  told  |||  them :
and in order to have a better understanding of the comics and the culture in them , i eventually started to learn a  |||  little  |||  japanese , as well .
because i also have a penchant for  |||  tradition  |||  , manners and customs .
on the one hand , japan is the  |||  land  |||  of the latest technologies and trends , but on the other hand it is strict , disciplined and traditional .
and because everything is so well - organized , i have n't felt  |||  lost  |||  yet , even though tokyo is the biggest city i 've ever seen .
when in danger , a rat or roach will run away . does it mean they experience  |||  fear  |||  , too ?
neuroscientist joseph ledoux is  |||  convinced  |||  that many animals have feelings , as well .
the internet magazine ' edge ' has been running pieces by  |||  famous  |||  scientists for years .
in a series , spiegel online presents a selection of responses to the question , ' what do you  |||  consider  |||  to be true without being able to prove it ? '
i believe that animals have feelings , as well as other modes of awareness , although neither i nor anybody else have been able to prove it to  |||  date  |||  . for that matter , we have n't even been able to prove that other people possess awareness .
but in that case , we can at least  |||  hope  |||  , since all human brains possess the same basic configuration .
as soon as we turn to other species and raise questions on feelings or awareness in  |||  general  |||  , however , we are entering difficult terrain , because the hardware is not compatible .
|||  humans  |||  behave similarly , which leads some scientists to conclude that the subjective experience is comparable .
there are two aspects of our brain  |||  structure  |||  that make it difficult to project our subjective experience onto animals .
so at least as far as these aspects of our awareness depending on the prefrontal cortex are concerned - among them the  |||  knowledge  |||  who we are and the ability to plan and to make decisions - there is reason to assume that humans are distinct even from other primates .
another dramatic distinction is likely to consist in man 's linguistic  |||  nature  |||  : because such a vast part of what humans experience is tied to language , it 's often said that their awareness depends on it .
in that case , animals could be  |||  excluded  |||  .
but even if awareness was not dependent on  |||  language  |||  , it would certainly be affected by it , meaning that animal awareness , however it may be defined , would likely be very different from most of our states of awareness .
that 's why it is so  |||  difficult  |||  to determine what animal awareness may be like .
if you have something that , being internal and subjective , can be neither measured nor - due to its special hardware - analyzed according to our own experience , then its study comes with  |||  significant  |||  challenges .
my explanation has mostly been concerned with the realm of conscious awareness , but aside from that , there is  |||  another  |||  important aspect of awareness that is more easily accessible scientifically .
animal awareness processes can be studied regardless of their content , and that 's exactly what 's  |||  happening  |||  in the study of the short - term memory of primates , particularly when it comes to the example of visualization .
interestingly , this  |||  approach  |||  also emphasizes the significance of the prefrontal cortex for the generation of the visualization .
what does this mean for  |||  feelings  |||  , now ?
let me remind you that an emotional system like that of  |||  fear  |||  is triggered in a brain that 's aware of its own activity .
what we  |||  call  |||  ' fear , ' consequently , is the mental state we are in when the activity of the defense system located in the brain ( or its effects , such as physical reactions ) is using virtual memory .
in contrast to this , antonio damasio supposes , for instance , that feelings result from more primitive activities in the areas of the cortext and the brainstem concerned with bodily sensations . jaak pankseep says something similar , but his  |||  focus  |||  is more on the brainstem .
|||  since  |||  this network had n't changed in the course of human evolution , they say , it might well be a cause of cross - species sensations .
pankseep argues that what seemed to be fear with rats and humans probably felt like it , as well , in both cases . but how can we determine whether rats and humans  |||  feel  |||  the same thing when they act in similar ways ?
a roach 's response to danger is flight . does it experience  |||  fear  |||  ?
as far as i 'm concerned , a mere similarity of  |||  actions  |||  is not sufficient proof for an identity of experiences .
the neural comparison is helpful , granted : rats and humans have  |||  similar  |||  brainstems , whereas roaches do not even have brains .
but is the brainstem  |||  responsible  |||  for emotions ?
but i would n't know how to  |||  prove  |||  it .
just like i do n't study  |||  language  |||  and awareness in rats , neither do i study their emotions , given that i do n't even know if they exist .
uefa president platini : reprieve for poland and  |||  ukraine  |||
ukrainian vice prime minister ivan vasyunik said that preparations would soon be transferred to the direct responsibility of the president and the  |||  prime minister  |||  .
' the government considers uefa 's decision a display of  |||  trust  |||  in ukraine and its ability to host the eurocup together with poland , ' vasyunik said .
' this is no amnesty for our  |||  country  |||  .
work has only just begun , and there is much still to be done in both  |||  countries  |||  . '
' we cannot  |||  waste  |||  any more time .
we have to proceed at great speed now , ' said grigoriy surkis , president of the  |||  ukrainian  |||  soccer association .
an even more radical measure was taken in  |||  poland  |||  .
after  |||  numerous  |||  scandals , the leadership of the polish association pzpn was suspended by the national olympic committee and replaced with independent administrator robert zawlocki .
there was ' the  |||  serious  |||  danger that the pzpn is not able to act according to the rules , ' drzeviecki told polish news agency pap .
' we have reassured uefa president michel platini in a letter that  |||  preparations  |||  for the euro 2012 will not suffer because of this . '
indignant dennis quaid strikes  |||  back  |||
she wanted to promote a new film , talked about personal  |||  matters  |||  in an interview - and now she 's in trouble with her ex : hollywood star meg ryan called her former husband dennis quaid an adulterer .
the latter is fuming at her - and strikes  |||  back  |||  .
belated marital war between  |||  former  |||  spouses meg ryan and dennis quaid : seven years after divorcing , the two hollywood actors are now engaged in an unsightly - and public - argument .
in an interview with u.s. magazine ' instyle ' last week , meg ryan had for the first time addressed the reasons for the failure of the marriage : ' dennis was cheating on me for a  |||  long  |||  time , and that was very painful . '
dennis quaid 's reaction to being portrayed as a cheating husband was unequivocal : it was ' outrageous , ' the 54 - year - old  |||  told  |||  the ' new york daily news , ' that ' meg is repeatedly rehashing and revising the history of our relationship . '
it was also ' regrettable ' that their  |||  common  |||  16 - year - old son jack was again ' publicly reminded of the pain and the upheavals a divorce brings for any child , ' he said .
while ryan has been  |||  living  |||  on her own since the divorce , quaid remarried and recently became the father of twins .
he concluded his comments with a sideswipe . ' my  |||  life  |||  has moved on , at any rate .
in the first half - year of 2008 , flights and rooms in europe were cheaper than in the  |||  previous  |||  year .
in germany , flight rates even dropped by as much as 50 percent , a  |||  current  |||  survey says .
rates for flights and hotel rooms have dropped again , according to a survey by travel and financial services provider  |||  american  |||  express .
analyzing its booking data from the first half - year of 2008 , the company found that , after an increase of rates in the first quarter , there was a significant drop in the  |||  second  |||  quarter .
from january to march , rates in 41 out of 48 analyzed european cities were still increasing by an  |||  average  |||  6.9 percent compared to 2007 .
but from april to june , rates had already dropped by 3.6 percent versus the  |||  previous  |||  year .
the trend was most visible in paris and  |||  rome  |||  , the survey says , where travelers had to pay between 30 and 37 percent less than a year ago .
|||  american  |||  express considers the weak dollar to be the reason for this , as it results in a ' decreasing desire for travel among american tourists . '
financial  |||  centers  |||  like frankfurt and london were hit harder by the dropping hotel rates than industry locations such as hannover , cologne or stavanger , it further says .
due to the increasing cost of kerosene , economy - class travelers had to pay 7.1 percent more on  |||  average  |||  than in 2007 , while rates for more fuel - intensive long - range flights even went up by as much as 29.2 percent .
from april to june , economy - class flight rates dropped by an average 12.5 percent versus the preceding quarter , whereas  |||  business  |||  - and first - class price changes were much less noticeable .
in germany ,  |||  rates  |||  dropped even more sharply than in other european countries .
the rates of domestic  |||  german  |||  flights were halved even , a survey says .
on the one hand , the sudden drop in rates was the result of the slowing  |||  economic  |||  growth , the company says .
|||  demand  |||  was receding in many segments of the air - travel market , it says .
among the signs of increasing tension were the cancelation of unprofitable routes at airlines , it says , as well as the high number of airlines filing for bankruptcy in the first half - year of 2008 - in europe  |||  alone  |||  , it was 24 airlines , it says .
at borussia , luhukay remains unable to find a  |||  working  |||  team .
he simply knew that he was  |||  right  |||  .
' we need the second goal , ' hermann rieger hissed in the hallway at hamburg  |||  arena  |||  .
rieger was hsv 's physiotherapist for nearly three  |||  decades  |||  . he is held in higher esteem than some other lapsed actors .
and thus , his plea was  |||  heard  |||  by the powers that be .
cornelius is the  |||  brother  |||  of hamburg 's coach - in - chief , martin jol .
' not everything was fun to look at today , ' marcell jansen later  |||  admitted  |||  .
hamburg has to thank mladen petric for scoring the 1-0 ( 1-0 ) with his header ( 11th ) ; and the fact that a very weak gladbach team proved  |||  unable  |||  to hit the weak hamburg team where it hurts .
' it was a  |||  dirty  |||  victory , ' martin jol summed things up .
spectators began celebrating on saturday evening -  |||  themselves  |||  , the blue sky above the arena and the instant chart on the video screen that showed their club as top of the class .
it 's going to be a birthday without a real  |||  party  |||  .
he senses that the chart 's intermediate report says more about the unpredictability of the liga than about the  |||  dominance  |||  of his hsv .
the  |||  team  |||  and its belatedly signed - on new members - brazilians neves and silva , goal - getter petric , as well as jansen , who was wooed away from fc bayern - are slowly finding their form , but they are not shining brightly yet .

large - scale investor warren buffet had bought into the  |||  company  |||  only a few days ago .
the bailout included the provision of  |||  funds  |||  for the acquisition of so - called bad mortgage certificates .
in turn , the united states was to obtain stock purchase warrants from the finance companies that could be discharged once share prices were appropriate , in order to  |||  reduce  |||  the burden on the national treasury .

for years , a mysterious phenomenon has had researchers stumped : dark matter is  |||  affecting  |||  the speed of space probes during so - called swing - by maneuvers .
experts fear that albert einstein 's  |||  general  |||  theory of relativity may not be entirely correct .
for almost 18 years , the probe ' ulysses ' has been flying through  |||  space  |||  .
among scientists , a mysterious phenomenon has been  |||  causing  |||  confusion for years - the swing - by anomaly .
it  |||  enables  |||  the probes to save a lot of fuel .
the european -  |||  american  |||  research probe cassini - huygens made use of this physical trick , as did the solar probe ulysses .
rather , there are irregularities in their  |||  speed  |||  .
to date , physicists have been  |||  unable  |||  to explain this effect .
some experts fear that even albert einstein 's  |||  general  |||  theory of relativity , which describes the gravitational pull of matter through a curvature of space , may not be entirely correct .
the  |||  american  |||  physicist stephen adler at the institute for advanced study in princeton still firmly believes that einstein did not err , and is trying to explain the swing - by anomaly by way of the so - called dark matter that astronomers discovered in the universe .
' it could be dark matter existing very  |||  close  |||  to earth that may be responsible for the anomaly , ' he writes .
space researchers have only been  |||  aware  |||  of the existence of dark matter for about ten years .
evidently , it emits a gravitational force whose  |||  effect  |||  on other celestial bodies is measurable .
according to the scientists ' calculations , dark  |||  matter  |||  constitutes as much as one fifth of all matter in the universe .
abducted tourists in  |||  egypt  |||  released
after being held hostage by their captors for ten days , the tourists abducted in egypt have evidently been released , as confirmed by the  |||  italian  |||  foreign minister .
the abductors from sudan had  |||  demanded  |||  a ransom of several million euros .
in the south of  |||  egypt  |||  , five germans have been abducted .
|||  negotiations  |||  concerning a ransom are reportedly already underway .
time and  |||  again  |||  , germans end up in the crosshairs of kidnappers .
' welt  |||  online  |||  ' reports the most notable cases .
the european tourists abducted in the sahara have  |||  apparently  |||  been freed .
reports by egyptian state television , the arabian tv channel al-arabiya and italian  |||  media  |||  are in accordance on that .
according to  |||  italian  |||  tv channel sky tg 24 , italian foreign minister franco frattini confirmed the release : ' our fellow citizens and the other hostages have been freed .
right now we are checking their  |||  health  |||  , ' frattini said .
the 19 participants of a  |||  desert  |||  expedition were already on their way to cairo , it said .
the circumstances of the shoot - out preceding the release remain unclear : according to an egyptian security agent , the captors were ready to end the abduction when the sudanese army suddenly  |||  killed  |||  six of the abductors .
' the problem had been  |||  solved  |||  .
it had been ' only a matter of receiving the hostages , ' when suddenly ' this  |||  surprise  |||  ' happened .
on sunday , sudanese soldiers had shot dead six of the abductors and taken two as prisoners in the  |||  border  |||  region between sudan , chad and egypt .
the abductors had demanded a ransom of six million euros from germany ; the money was to be delivered by the  |||  german  |||  wife of one of the hostages .
citing a german negotiator , the daily newspaper ' el masri el jom '  |||  reported  |||  that the release was being delayed because the kidnappers were fearing for their safety .
the men were to be  |||  held  |||  captive until the abductors would have secured an escape route .
the  |||  german  |||  embassy in cairo declined to comment on the report .
stepfather abuse " led to  |||  suicide  |||  "
michael trerise , 57 , of stithians , cornwall , was jailed for six  |||  years  |||  after he admitted eight counts of indecent assault .
truro crown court  |||  heard  |||  he regularly tied up his step - daughter stephanie randle , when she was aged between five and seven .
trerise wrote in a confession note : " i feel  |||  responsible  |||  for her death . "
the court heard that ms randle killed herself at her  |||  home  |||  in mutley , plymouth , on 1 april 2007 , aged 34 .
his step -  |||  daughter  |||  went to plymouth .
by 2006 , prosecutor ramsey quaife told the  |||  court  |||  , friends said ms randle , who had been a keen surfer and cyclist , was " emotionally dead " , and had " given up on life " .
in april 2007 her  |||  real  |||  father , terrance randle , found her dead at her flat in plymouth .
i feel responsible for her  |||  death  |||  . "
judge christopher elwen  |||  told  |||  trerise : " you are an extremely strange fetishist , and for your victim it must have been terrifying , especially when she was only seven .
even more stark , is the fact that had she not done so , it 's very doubtful that  |||  matters  |||  would have ended up in court . "
" she was plainly otherwise likely to have been a promising , successful and  |||  happy  |||  young woman . "
|||  lost  |||  data official to be charged
the cabinet office official who  |||  left  |||  top - secret documents on a train in june is to be charged under the official secrets act , the bbc has learned .
the man was on secondment from the ministry of defence when he  |||  left  |||  two highly classified documents on a train to waterloo .
the documents were passed to the bbc before being handed over to the  |||  police  |||  .
it is the least sensitive charge under the act and there is no suggestion of  |||  criminal  |||  intent .
bbc defence correspondent frank gardner said the  |||  move  |||  would have come as a surprise to many in whitehall .
" they will have  |||  thought  |||  this was being dealt with internally at the mod and cabinet office , " he said .
the employee , who cannot be named , is being charged under section 8.1 of the act , the  |||  clause  |||  which deals with safeguarding information .
the crown prosecution service recommended the official should be charged by the metropolitan police due to the highly sensitive  |||  nature  |||  of his work on the joint intelligence committee .
he was informed of the decision on monday morning and was moved from his  |||  home  |||  to an undisclosed location .
building societies  |||  face  |||  b&b bill
the government  |||  provided  |||  gbp 14bn to protect the deposits of bradford & bingley 's 2.6 million savers .
the  |||  interest  |||  on that loan will be paid by all firms that take savers ' money , including the 59 building societies .
the director  |||  general  |||  of the building societies association ( bsa ) adrian coles said it was " galling " that societies and their members had to pay .
the gbp 14bn loan will eventually be repaid as bradford & bingley 's  |||  mortgages  |||  are redeemed .
but the interest which will accrue in the meantime will be charged  |||  each  |||  year to the 700 financial companies which take deposits .
the financial services compensation scheme confirmed to the bbc that the 59 building societies would be included in that  |||  number  |||  .
it is galling that those  |||  institutions  |||  that behaved prudently ... are now being called upon to pay some of the bills of those institutions that were far less prudent
the treasury estimates that the  |||  interest  |||  on the loan will amount to gbp 450m in 2009 .
that means the societies will have to find gbp 81m to pay the first year 's  |||  interest  |||  .
adrian coles , director  |||  general  |||  of the building societies ' trade association , told the bbc he believes that is unfair .
" it is galling that those  |||  institutions  |||  that behaved prudently in the housing market upswing are now being called upon to pay some of the bills of those institutions that were far less prudent . "
according to the bsa , no society has failed  |||  since  |||  its records began in 1945 .
" we will need to examine all the aspects of this over the next few weeks to see what options there are to protect building societies and their members from what could be a  |||  significant  |||  bill , " added mr cole .
in 2010 a  |||  full  |||  year 's interest will be due and that could be almost twice as much .
since building societies are mutual organisations with no shareholders , their members will end up paying the bill either through higher charges or lower  |||  interest  |||  rates on saving accounts .
|||  milk  |||  to go up five pence a litre
people in jersey are facing having to pay more for their  |||  milk  |||  .
jersey dairy has announced that it will  |||  increase  |||  the wholesale price of its milk by an extra five pence a litre from monday .
retailers are to  |||  decide  |||  for themselves if they want pass on the price increases to their customers .
before the february  |||  increase  |||  , the wholesale price of jersey milk last changed in 2002 .
a bangladesh court has rejected a bail plea of  |||  former  |||  pm sheikh hasina , meaning that she could be arrested when she returns to the country .
her lawyers said the  |||  court  |||  refused to grant her bail over charges of extorting 50 million taka ( $ 729,700 ) from a businessman when she was pm .
the case is one of several corruption  |||  charges  |||  pending against her .
sheikh hasina 's long - time political rival , khaleda zia , was released on bail  |||  earlier  |||  this month .
sheikh hasina is due to return to bangladesh over the next few weeks but her party , the awami league , has demanded that the country 's military - backed caretaker government should first give her  |||  full  |||  freedom .
correspondents say that while she was given parole to go abroad for medical treatment , it is not clear under the  |||  terms  |||  of her release whether she will be able to remain at liberty when she returns to bangladesh .
" the high court rejected sheikh hasina 's bail petition  |||  saying  |||  that she does n't have to get bail as she 's already undergoing treatment abroad on parole , " her barrister rafique - ul huq said .
her lawyers argued that she  |||  needed  |||  bail to come back to the country from abroad to prepare for elections in december .
sheikh hasina is expected to return  |||  home  |||  after 17 october , a senior awami league party leader said on sunday .
she was detained last year after the army - backed interim government assumed power , but was  |||  released  |||  from prison in june , to go abroad for medical treatment .
the un carried out a vaccination programme in six provinces  |||  last  |||  week .
but it says it could not  |||  reach  |||  children in parts of helmand and kandahar in the south for security reasons .
a un spokesman said this was despite pledges from the taleban that they would not attack or obstruct thousands of  |||  staff  |||  carrying out the vaccinations .
bskyb has lost its legal challenge to the competition commission 's decision forcing the  |||  firm  |||  to reduce its stake in rival broadcaster itv .
bskyb has been told by the competition  |||  appeal  |||  tribunal to cut its holding in itv from 17.9 % to below 7.5 % .
previously , the commission said that bskyb 's stake thwarted  |||  competition  |||  and allowed it unfair influence over itv .
in april 2007 , the office of fair trading  |||  reported  |||  that bskyb 's acquisition of its stake in itv shed doubt on the independence of itv , prompting the competition commission to launch a probe .
virgin boss sir richard branson , consumer groups and the regulator ofcom all opposed the  |||  purchase  |||  .
bskyb argued that forcing it to  |||  reduce  |||  its itv stake was unreasonable and a disproportionate remedy - particularly as bskyb had said it would surrender its voting rights .
the us attorney general has  |||  appointed  |||  a special prosecutor to look into the firing of nine us attorneys in 2006 .
the  |||  move  |||  came as a report into the affair by the inspector general of the justice department criticised the actions of administration officials .
special prosecutor nora dannehy will now investigate whether  |||  officials  |||  questioned during the probe lied to investigators in an attempt to obstruct justice .
" serious allegations involving potential criminal conduct have not been fully investigated or resolved , " inspector  |||  general  |||  glenn fine said in his report .
the appointment of a special prosecutor with the  |||  power  |||  to force witnesses to testify was one of his key recommendations .
the row began when nine us attorneys were removed from their  |||  positions  |||  by the us department of justice in december 2006 .
some of the attorneys had been  |||  involved  |||  in the prosecution of high - profile republican members of congress , while others had refused to investigate allegations of voter fraud against democrats .
the then head of the justice department , attorney general alberto gonzales , came under  |||  fire  |||  for the sackings , and eventually resigned his position .
a number of other  |||  justice  |||  department officials also resigned .
the inspector  |||  general  |||  's report was highly critical of mr gonzales 's role in the affair , saying he bore " primary responsibility " for the sackings , that he " abdicated " his leadership role and was " remarkably unengaged " in the process .
the singer , who will collect his special golden award at  |||  next  |||  week 's ceremony in london , said he was " honoured " to gain recognition .
coldplay are  |||  leading  |||  the nominations for this year 's awards , making the shortlists of four categories .
paul rees , q magazine 's editor - in -  |||  chief  |||  , said : " there are some songs that transcend such things as time and genre , and bat out of hell is assuredly one of them . "
it opened with an instrumental  |||  section  |||  which lasted almost two minutes .
the song was released as a  |||  single  |||  in the uk in 1979 and peaked at number 15 .
but meat loaf 's bat out of hell album spent around nine years in the chart and went on to sell more than 40 million copies  |||  worldwide  |||  .
meat loaf -  |||  real  |||  name marvin lee aday - has suffered health problems in recent years , including surgery for an irregular heartbeat in 2003 after collapsing on stage .
in 2007 , acute laryngitis forced him to cancel  |||  concerts  |||  .
new york city has thousands of avenues , boulevards , streets and other byways , some  |||  famous  |||  , others merely utilitarian .
the tiny street is in the east village and runs north from first street - without making it to  |||  second  |||  street - between the bowery and second avenue .
for instance , there is avalon bay , the developer of recently constructed  |||  luxury  |||  buildings on first street .
it wants to repave extra place and create a cleaner passageway to the shops and boutiques that are expected to  |||  open  |||  in the new buildings .
other admirers  |||  include  |||  longtime neighbors who said they were charmed by the truncated lane simply because it was one of the last remnants of the block 's pregentrified past .
but the city 's department of housing preservation and development , which has control of the street , has no interest in  |||  holding  |||  on to it .
at a  |||  meeting  |||  of the neighborhood community board 's land use committee this month , representatives of the city agency and avalon bay outlined a proposal for the developer to buy the street .
but the committee prefers that the street  |||  remain  |||  in the city 's hands , and it asked for a new plan to be submitted next month , said susan stetzer , the district manager of community board 3 .
" there 's very  |||  little  |||  city - owned space left , and we would like the city to continue to own extra place , " she said .
" there could be proposals to fix it up and manage it , which could be done by avalon , but we also want to  |||  guarantee  |||  public access . "
avalon bay announced several months ago that it wanted to repave the  |||  little  |||  street and install seats , including some to be used by a cafe to which the developer expects to lease space .
the idea that avalon bay  |||  might  |||  buy the street was first made public at this month 's meeting .
michele de milly , a spokeswoman for avalon bay , said that  |||  though  |||  the company wanted to use the street , it did not necessarily want to own it .
" avalon bay 's principal concern is refurbishing this derelict alleyway and turning it into a  |||  public  |||  amenity , " she said , adding that the city had suggested the sale .
some  |||  believe  |||  it got its name in 1802 , when a large farm owned by philip minthorne was split up among several of his children and the narrow strip of land was unclaimed .
some residents , including bloggers who write about the gentrification of the east village , have opposed the idea of selling extra place , arguing that the piece of public property , modest as it is , should  |||  remain  |||  public .
others have lauded extra place as a rarity - a virtually unchanged sliver of the city that  |||  ought  |||  to be left alone .
jeremiah moss , who runs a blog called jeremiah 's vanishing new york ( subtitled , " the book of lamentations : a bitterly nostalgic  |||  look  |||  at a city in the process of going extinct " ) , posted part of a talk of the town story about extra place that appeared in the new yorker in 1952 .
the author , brendan gill , wrote : " extra place is a  |||  narrow  |||  little dead - end street , dark even by day and marked off by rusty iron warehouse doors and shuttered windows , with week - old newspapers blowing along the gutters . "
with a few exceptions , the street looked much the same on a  |||  recent  |||  evening .
a rat skittered across the back of the street near a door that used to  |||  lead  |||  into cbgb , which is now the site of an upscale clothing store .
graffiti was on walls and an empty 22 - ounce beer bottle lay near a  |||  fresh  |||  batch of discarded newspapers .
mr. fields , for his part , said he  |||  thought  |||  that some people were underestimating the appeal of the street in its current state .
" the best years of my life , " he said , " were in places that were  |||  dark  |||  , damp and disgusting . "
the bilingual  |||  debate  |||  : english immersion
in this installment of education watch , bruce fuller and lance t. izumi discuss the candidates '  |||  positions  |||  on bilingual education .
lance t. izumi , a senior fellow in california studies and the senior director of education studies at the pacific research institute for public policy , is the co - author of the book " not as good as you think : why the middle class needs school  |||  choice  |||  . "
making effective appeals to hispanic  |||  voters  |||  is a tricky business .
mr. obama 's campaign notes that , " african -  |||  american  |||  and latino students are significantly less likely to graduate than white students , " which is true .
to combat such achievement gaps , mr. obama 's education plan specifically  |||  advocates  |||  , among other things , " transitional bilingual education " for english - learners .
yet , the question for mr. obama is whether his commitment to bilingual education , which emphasizes classroom instruction in languages other than  |||  english  |||  , overrides his interest in closing achievement gaps .
take , for example , sixth street prep , a charter elementary  |||  school  |||  in eastern los angeles county .
a nearly equally amazing 93 percent of fourth graders tested proficient on the state english -  |||  language  |||  - arts exam .
sixth street emphasizes review and practice ,  |||  constant  |||  assessment of skills and a no - excuses attitude .
furthermore , and here 's where mr. obama should take note , according to linda mikels , sixth street 's principal , the school 's instructional approach for english learners is "  |||  full  |||  immersion . "
english immersion emphasizes the  |||  near  |||  - exclusive use of english in content instruction .
ms. mikels , who opposes bilingual education ,  |||  told  |||  me , " we 've had tremendous success with having a student who is brand new from mexico and you would walk into a classroom 12 months later and you would n't be able to pick out which one he was . "
" it 's  |||  working  |||  , " she observed , " it 's working for us . "
the school 's achievement results should make the answer to that question a no - brainer , but the education politics within his own party ( the national education associations has been a long - time supporter of bilingual education ) and his own  |||  consistent  |||  support for bilingual education obscure predicting mr. obama 's response .
while he agrees that immigrants should learn english , mr. obama recently trivialized the  |||  issue  |||  when he said that people should stop worrying about " english - only " legislation .
instead , he said , " you need to make  |||  sure  |||  your child can speak spanish . "
if mr. obama truly wishes to close achievement gaps , he should carefully  |||  consider  |||  education models that work rather than scorn or trivialize them .
oil falls sharply on  |||  renewed  |||  economic fears
oil prices dropped sharply on monday because of concerns that even the  |||  american  |||  bailout plan for the financial markets may fail to revive the economy .
crude oil futures fell as much as 7 percent to $ 99.80 a barrel on the new york mercantile  |||  exchange  |||  in morning trading .
in the last two weeks , commodity markets have been shaken by the financial turmoil on wall street , and a pair of  |||  powerful  |||  hurricanes in the gulf of mexico .
the news was overshadowed by fresh  |||  concerns  |||  that the financial crisis was far from over .
in the  |||  latest  |||  episode of the unfolding meltdown , citigroup will buy the banking operations of the wachovia corporation , the government said monday .
meanwhile , the belgian ,  |||  dutch  |||  and luxembourg governments partially nationalized the european financial conglomerate fortis .
as the  |||  economic  |||  situation deteriorates , the demand for commodities , including oil , is expected to slow down .
" we believe commodities will be unable to  |||  escape  |||  the contagion .
from a commodity perspective our most pressing  |||  concern  |||  is to what extent the us virus spreads globally and specifically to china . "
the bank 's analysts pared down their expectations for next year as oil consumption drops because of slowing  |||  economic  |||  growth , reducing their oil and gas price forecasts by about 20 percent for 2009 .
second - quarter spree sets team  |||  record  |||
after spending more time in a jets uniform the last eight - plus seasons than anyone , defensive end shaun ellis  |||  thought  |||  he had seen it all .
then he watched the  |||  second  |||  quarter unfold sunday , when the jets transformed a scoreless game into a blowout .
" never seen  |||  anything  |||  quite like that , " ellis said .
the second quarter  |||  began  |||  after the jets and the arizona cardinals had matched the gloomy clouds hanging overhead with sloppy play .
then quarterback brett favre found laveranues coles for a 12 - yard touchdown strike , providing the  |||  perfect  |||  harbinger for an afternoon when their evolving connection took a giant leap forward .
" he 's a hell of a  |||  player  |||  .
while favre and coles played catch , the  |||  defense  |||  battered cardinals quarterback kurt warner .
cornerback darrelle revis intercepted an errant throw and  |||  returned  |||  it 32 yards for a touchdown .
safety eric smith tipped  |||  another  |||  pass and intercepted it .
linebacker david bowens  |||  forced  |||  a fumble by warner .
the cardinals had taken over on that possession with 10 seconds left , and after the jets recovered the ball , jay feely kicked a 20 - yard field goal for a 34-0  |||  lead  |||  .
it was the most the jets had ever scored in a  |||  quarter  |||  .
asked to describe the craziness of it , jets coach eric mangini said , " the  |||  second  |||  quarter or the third quarter ? "
when he was told both - the jets  |||  allowed  |||  21 unanswered points in the third quarter - mangini said : " i can tell you i enjoyed the second quarter a lot more than i did the third quarter .
rested gebrselassie tops his world  |||  record  |||
haile gebrselassie of ethiopia again showed why many  |||  consider  |||  him the greatest distance runner ever , breaking his own world record in the marathon in berlin on sunday and becoming the first person to run the 26.2 - mile race under 2 hours 4 minutes .
with a victory on the accommodatingly flat course in 2:03:59 , gebrselassie shattered by 27 seconds his previous mark of 2:04:26 , run  |||  last  |||  year in berlin .
at 35 , gebrselassie set the 26th world  |||  record  |||  of a career of such stunning breadth that he has produced a world championship or world record at every distance from the metric mile to the marathon .
|||  last  |||  month , gebrselassie skipped the olympic marathon in beijing , fearing - perhaps too alarmingly , in retrospect - that the air pollution would exacerbate his problems with asthma .
instead , he signed to run in  |||  berlin  |||  .
in near perfect conditions - sunny and 48 degrees at the  |||  start  |||  , 55 degrees at the finish - gebrselassie won sunday while averaging a blistering 4 minutes 43 seconds per mile .
as track runners like gebrselassie and paul tergat of kenya have turned to longer distances , the  |||  record  |||  for the marathon has fallen by more than two minutes in the past decade , since ronaldo da costa of brazil won in berlin in 2:06:05 in 1998 .
after sunday 's victory , gebrselassie told reporters that he had cramps in his calf two weeks ago and had missed a week of  |||  training  |||  .
" i 'm so happy , " gebrselassie  |||  told  |||  reporters .
" everything was  |||  perfect  |||  .
i started again a week ago , and had some doubts today , but in the end everything was  |||  fine  |||  . "
he has come under some criticism - especially in kenya , ethiopia 's east african rival - for overly orchestrating his races , generally avoiding many of the world 's top marathon stars , relying on pacemakers as if it were a track  |||  race  |||  , and placing world records ahead of a sense of competition .
but this criticism  |||  hardly  |||  diminishes the greatness of gebrselassie 's skill as a distance runner .
paced by four kenyans on sunday , gebrselassie  |||  reached  |||  the midway point in 1:02:04 .
two  |||  elite  |||  kenyan runners , james kwambai and charles kamathi , kept challenging gebrselassie after the pacemakers faded .
a  |||  little  |||  more than three miles from the finish , gebrselassie made a final surge to separate from kwambai , who finished second in 2:05:36 , improving his personal best by nearly five minutes .
kamathi took  |||  third  |||  in 2:07:48 .
in the women 's  |||  race  |||  , irina mikitenko , a native of kazakhstan who is now a german citizen , completed a remarkable year by winning in 2:19:19 , the seventh - fastest time ever .
paula radcliffe of great britain  |||  holds  |||  the world record of 2:15:25 .
last  |||  spring  |||  , mikitenko , 36 , was a surprise winner of the london marathon in 2:24:14 .
she missed the beijing games with what was described as a  |||  back  |||  injury , but recovered to win in berlin , setting a personal best by nearly five minutes in the third marathon she has run .
askale tafa magarsa of ethiopia took second in 2:21.31 , while helena kiprop of kenya  |||  finished  |||  third in 2:25:01 .
hidden in the theme - park sprawl of greater orlando , a few miles from the shiny , the loud and the gargantuan , lies a  |||  quiet  |||  town where the pride and complications of the african - american experience come to life .
alice walker , toni morrison and ruby dee have come to the  |||  annual  |||  zora ! festival in eatonville to pay their respects to hurston , the most famous female writer of the harlem renaissance .
it is as independent , dignified and private as it was in the 1930s , when hurston wrote that rural blacks in florida often resisted sharing their true thoughts with the white man , who " knowing so  |||  little  |||  about us , he does n't know what he is missing . "
even now , in a year when a black presidential nominee , senator barack obama , has called for an open conversation about race , many here  |||  remain  |||  wary of the outsider 's gaze .
" it needs to be  |||  right  |||  . "
it is a literary hub but also an oak - shaded example of rural southern black culture - sometimes disdained , sometimes praised - that was born of  |||  american  |||  slavery .
not surprisingly , residents here are both  |||  proud  |||  and protective .
and the  |||  concern  |||  about eatonville 's image really began with zora , which is all anyone here calls hurston .
five paragraphs in the florida guidebook transformed the town , just off route 17 , a road that runs through the oft - forgotten center of florida into a stage of  |||  black  |||  history and human drama .
" off the road on the  |||  left  |||  , " she wrote , " is the brown - with - white - trim modern public school , with its well - kept yards and playgrounds , which howard miller always looks after , though he can scarcely read and write . "
she also  |||  mentioned  |||  the new husband of widow dash and wrote that lee glenn " sells drinks of all kinds and whatever goes with transient rooms . "
in fact , it was not a portrait  |||  everyone  |||  appreciated .
" zora  |||  told  |||  it like it was , " said ella dinkins , 90 , one of the johnson girls hurston immortalized by quoting men singing off - color songs about their beauty .
hurston is still remembered here as a vivacious eccentric who frequently returned after her  |||  family  |||  moved to jacksonville , fla.
augustus franklin , 77 , recalled that when hurston sped into town , she usually  |||  arrived  |||  without notice in a thumping chevrolet , smoking and wearing pants in a town that even today prides itself on dignified dress .
most  |||  residents  |||  were fascinated , mr. franklin said , while many sneered .
" people were  |||  always  |||  glad to see zora , " mr. franklin said .
but , he added , rocking in his chair on a  |||  back  |||  patio overlooking lake sabelia , where hurston was most likely baptized , " she never did stay too long . "
when hurston died in 1960 , she was  |||  poor  |||  and her books had fallen out of print .
along with much of the world , eatonville seemed to have  |||  forgotten  |||  her .
though she was once a literary star , a contemporary of langston hughes and the only black woman at barnard college in the 1920s , she was buried in an unmarked grave in fort pierce , fla. , where she had been  |||  living  |||  .
in eatonville , there were no  |||  major  |||  memorial services , no grand public readings .
a turning point  |||  came  |||  in the 1980s .
orange county  |||  officials  |||  wanted to put a five - lane highway through town to replace kennedy boulevard , the community 's puttering two - lane main street .
orlando 's sprawl had already pushed interstate 4 through the western edge of  |||  town  |||  .
the proposal came as eatonville was still recovering from a  |||  difficult  |||  period in its history .
|||  forced  |||  integration , among other things , had ended the community 's relatively idyllic isolation .
in the 1950s , the fight over racial mixing  |||  brought  |||  hate to the community 's doorstep .
" during that time , a bunch of white boys , they would come through and throw oranges and things at people sitting down on the  |||  side  |||  , " mr. franklin said .
in a 1955 letter to the orlando sentinel , hurston questioned the supreme court 's demand for  |||  forced  |||  integration , calling its decision in brown v. board of education " insulting rather than honoring my race . "
residents now say that the desegregation of schools , while positive in some respects , diluted eatonville 's cohesiveness and undermined the confidence of its  |||  youth  |||  .
"  |||  black  |||  children were accustomed to being hugged - i remember this - you hugged your teacher in the morning , you hugged your teacher at night , " said n. y. nathiri , the daughter of ella dinkins and the executive director of preserve the eatonville community , a nonprofit group .
civil rights , however ,  |||  helped  |||  create space for many more zora neale hurstons - black writers , actors and artists who rose above prejudice , like she did , with buoyant self - assurance and lines like : " how can any deny themselves the pleasure of my company !
in 1975 , the writer alice walker trekked to hurston 's unmarked grave and  |||  began  |||  fighting to resurrect her reputation .
five years later , an acclaimed hurston biography by robert e. hemenway hit bookshelves , reintroducing her to the  |||  american  |||  canon .
the highway project  |||  arrived  |||  just as eatonville 's most famous daughter had once again found the spotlight .
the community began planning in 1988 for a hurston festival to  |||  show  |||  what the county could ruin with its highway .
after  |||  several  |||  years , the county backed away from its road proposal .
" the five - laning of the highway resurrected , it put in what you 'd call warp speed ,  |||  real  |||  civic pride , " ms. nathiri said .
ms. boyd put it more simply : " zora  |||  saved  |||  eatonville . "
victory over the highway project has  |||  helped  |||  change the town 's self - image .
out - of - towners like rachelle munson , a lawyer who began coming to church here in 1993 , started to  |||  appear  |||  in larger numbers , and residents started to revalue the past .
eatonville joined the  |||  national  |||  historic registry in 1998 .
a new one - story library ( named after hurston , of course )  |||  opened  |||  in 2006 on a repaved and beautified kennedy boulevard .
( it is 90 percent  |||  black  |||  today . )
outsiders who come looking for eatonville 's story , its meaning , are often still  |||  treated  |||  with caution .
advance permission is  |||  required  |||  for most interviews , and certain things - like the murals at eatonville 's oldest church , painted by a white man , showing black men in the fields - are not allowed to be photographed .
and even those who are younger , like alondra and alexia kenon , 11 - year - old twins from winter park , seem to have learned to  |||  describe  |||  eatonville correctly .
" most people , if they just drive through here , they 'll think , ' oh , this city is nothing compared to any of the other ones , ' " alondra kenon said after church on a  |||  recent  |||  sunday .
over here in new york we all  |||  speak  |||  fluent finance
on the face of it , nothing has  |||  changed  |||  .
they would never guess that in the glass - fronted , honeycomb offices  |||  above  |||  their heads the bankers and hedge fund managers who monopolise new york are daily having the worst " bad day at the office " since the crash of 1929 .
latino men still shuffle between apartment buildings carrying , like  |||  human  |||  mules , 50 - odd pressed shirts hanging from a yoke across their shoulders .
even  |||  though  |||  i had timed the chore to coincide with the late afternoon lull at my local branch of jp morgan chase , a queue of 20 or so people was already waiting in line .
unlike me , however , they had already withdrawn savings from smaller banks in places from where they commuted , from the likes of new jersey , pennsylvania and staten  |||  island  |||  .
they had taken out money from so - called thrifts ( a bit like a  |||  building  |||  society ) , credit unions and the type of hometown savings banks whose branches only operate within one state , and who say they treat customers like family .
in the  |||  past  |||  year , 15 of these banks have quietly gone bust .
the office and shop workers standing in front of me , scared of  |||  another  |||  collapse , were moving their cash to a bank perceived to be a safe haven , the bank that is doing most of the bailing out on wall street .
|||  ordinary  |||  new yorkers in the last few weeks have become fluent in finance .
she told me , after my  |||  visit  |||  to the bank , that " i got all my savings in money market funds now .
|||  muslim  |||  graves desecrated as austria swings to the right
police are blaming far right extremists for desecrating a muslim cemetery in austria , the same weekend that the political parties of the far right made huge gains in the country 's  |||  general  |||  election .
over 90 graves were severely damaged at the cemetery in traun , near linz , some time between friday night and this morning , in what police believe was an organised  |||  action  |||  .
the offenders sprayed jewish symbols such as the star of david over some of the graves , but detectives  |||  believe  |||  this may have been a bid to disguise the motives of extremists driven by a hatred of muslim immigrants .
it is not  |||  clear  |||  whether the incident was in any way related to the elections .
a spokesman for the local islamic community said they were " deeply shocked " at the news of the desecration , which  |||  comes  |||  as the muslim religious month of ramadan nears its end .
austria is meanwhile embarking on a round of soul - searching following its swing to the  |||  right  |||  in yesterday 's parliamentary elections .
heinz - christian strache , the head of the freedom party that won over 18 per cent of the vote , campaigned against headscarves and burkas and even expressed his opposition to foods that are perceived to be  |||  related  |||  to islam .
at his final rally in vienna , he spoke of a " european brotherhood " to  |||  prevent  |||  the rise of islam .
both parties seek to ban the building of mosques and minarets , arguing that they were political symbols of an  |||  ongoing  |||  islamisation of austria and europe .
polls and analysis conducted immediately after the elections , which established the far right as the country 's strongest political bloc , indicate that the change was brought about by predominately young voters who are  |||  concerned  |||  about their future in the european union .
gary glitter , the glam rock star  |||  convicted  |||  of child sex abuse , has been banned by the courts from travelling to france and spain .
magistrates imposed the six month ban on glitter after he  |||  informed  |||  the authorities monitoring him that he wanted to travel to spain via france .
a  |||  court  |||  service spokesman said : " on thursday september 25 at ashford magistrates ' court , kent police applied for an application to prevent foreign travel to france and spain until march 25 by mr paul gadd .
" paul gadd did not attend in  |||  person  |||  . "
glitter , 64 , had  |||  informed  |||  the authorities that he wished to travel abroad as he is required to under the sex offenders register .
he must give the authorities notice if he wishes to  |||  travel  |||  abroad for more than three days .
he is also required to give police seven days notice of his  |||  planned  |||  departure date .
failure to notify the authorities could lead to a five  |||  year  |||  prison sentence .
kent police said they would not  |||  discuss  |||  individual cases or the possible whereabouts of glitter in the county .
a kent police spokeswoman said : " kent police will do everything  |||  necessary  |||  to protect children in this country , or abroad .
glitter returned to the uk  |||  last  |||  month after spending 27 months in a vietnamese jail for the abuse of two girls , aged 10 and 11 .
the thai authorities would not allow him through passport  |||  control  |||  and he eventually flew to hong kong .
chinese authorities also refused him entry and he flew  |||  back  |||  to bangkok where thai police and immigration officials insisted he return to britain .
he eventually arrived at heathrow 's terminal 3 on august 22 and stayed there while his solicitor david corker went to uxbridge magistrates court , west london , as scotland yard successfully applied for an  |||  order  |||  requiring him to register as a sex offender .
glitter had previously been jailed in the uk for  |||  four  |||  months in 1999 for possessing images of child abuse .
a  |||  home  |||  office source said that jacqui smith , the home secretary was reassured and glad that glitter has been stopped from travelling to france and spain .
" i photograph the  |||  master  |||  away from the scene to extract his character " günther bauer , photographer
only the essence of the great masters of flamenco , stripped of the concentration which characterizes the  |||  interpretation  |||  , to face a relaxed man or woman .
on one hand , the  |||  artist  |||  .
on the other , the  |||  person  |||  .
the two sides are inseparable , except in private life . in those moments ,  |||  away  |||  from the public , the privacy of a gesture , the depth of a stolen glance or the expressiveness of the hands , are natural expressions because not prepared for the stage .
german günther bauer , in the work " flamenco - people " , alternates the theatricality of some shots of singers , dancers and guitarists on stage with these masters ' private and less  |||  known  |||  being .
this is the photograph 's aim when collecting an original iconography of flamenco , taken from  |||  different  |||  perspectives .
the people i portrayed on the street " are " artists able to convey passion , sadness and joy when on  |||  stage  |||  ... and finally , to capture their audience .
it is much more an inner personality and  |||  character  |||  .
i 'm very interested in  |||  creating  |||  an intimate atmosphere which permits me to capture the personality of the greats of flamenco by my camera . "
bauer  |||  began  |||  his path to portray singers , guitarists and dancers in 1997 with a deep passion for the festival " cante de las minas " . he likes to use a plate camera .
the application of different stylistic techniques breaks with the iconographic traditional principles ,  |||  giving  |||  the photos modernity , as bauer considers flamenco : " a music with very traditional roots which evolves and still surprises every day more . "
it is not the dancing , the singing or the playing  |||  itself  |||  , but the artist 's personality , his character , able to conquer the audience through his art .
the search for a meeting with the essentiality , with the magic that becomes visible in a certain feeling , are and have been  |||  constant  |||  elements in this work , now on display at the gallery el fotómata .
|||  famous  |||  flamenco artists such as diego el cigala , chan lobato , cristina hoyos , enrique morente , el lebrija , antonio canales and vicente amigo among others , are included in this selection of around seventy portrayed artists .
although in " flamenco - people " the concept is  |||  different  |||  , the photographer admits " i love to portray people , to know them and to penetrate into their lives for a while , being this a long or short moment .

the collection of portraits of contemporary flamenco ,  |||  entitled  |||  " flamenco - people " is exhibited at the gallery el fotómata , via de la mata 20 , which is a parallel street to alameda de hercules . the exhibition will be open to public until the 16th of october .
the novel sets in a place the author does not know yet and tells of an unknown subject . despite this , mario vargas llosa is struggling with the new project he is  |||  working  |||  at , a novel whose protagonist , roger casemant , is an irish nationalist who spent twenty years of his life in congo and crossed amazon .
the writer , always favoured for the nobel prize in literature , confessed yesterday during the hay festival in segovia , that the draft he is dealing with is a " chance " and that everything indicates that i should not  |||  write  |||  it down . "
the hispanic - american novelist , acknowledged that " there is no way to measure how and how much books can affect people 's lives . i refuse to  |||  believe  |||  that literature is a pure and ephemeral entertainment experience , " said vargas llosa who , also supported that " the literature has a strong impact and pushes people to be nonconformist . " so he suggested the writers " not to give into frivolity " and to " take the responsibility " of their own vocation .
the bullfights which were to seal the days of the festival of pozoblanco were suspended yesterday  |||  morning  |||  after the bull fighters had assured that the square 's soil conditions were not adequate for the celebrations .
therefore , the  |||  company  |||  , together with fermin bohorquez , pablo hermoso de mendoza and leonardo hernandez , decided to suspend the bullfighting .
among all , the worst was el juli , who  |||  passed  |||  by the bull - ring of los llanos gaining no glory , no penalty .
with the  |||  second  |||  bull , after a tremendous muleta , he earned the boos of a bigger part of the public .

the officials chased the van until the vehicle  |||  stopped  |||  after a couple of miles on the edge of the road , and its two occupants flew into a wooded area .
the ertzaintza officials managed to arrest one of the fugitives and , after the inspection of the van -- an iveco  |||  daily  |||  , seized 2178 kilograms of hashish .
the ertzaintza is continuing its investigations to arrest the second suspected person who  |||  managed  |||  to flee as mentioned above , and to determine the origin of seized drugs .

llamazares urges the andalusian federation of iu to assume its responsibilities in the silva  |||  case  |||
gaspar llamazares , the  |||  general  |||  coordinator of iu and member of the party izquierda unida , confirmed today that the decision for the case concerning the councillor for youth and sport of the city of siviglia , francisco manuel silva , who resigned last week after the accusation of cronyism . the case will be up to the regional federation for training .
moreover , the leader stressed the need for " transparency " in all possible investigations regarding whatever irregularity silva had  |||  committed  |||  , " the ui always wanted these kind of investigations to have the maximum transparency . "
similarly , he stressed that training goes under " very strict codes of ethics for all  |||  public  |||  functions . "
jose luis garci , inspired by the novel episodios nacionales of banito pérez galdós , recreates in sangre de mayo the spanish popular riot against the  |||  french  |||  . this is the most ambitious work of his filmography , with a nearly 15 million euro budget .
with this film , the director has tried to " explain the torrent of characters and at the same time the social analysis " that he always admired in the work of the  |||  famous  |||  novelist , he said today , during the film 's presentation , with quim gutierrez and paula echevarría heading a larger cast of interpreters .
sangre de mayo , a film longer than 2.30 hours , debuts this friday at the cinemas , to become a four hours tv miniseries on telemadrid in next  |||  future  |||  .
however , the director regrets not having  |||  received  |||  equal funds of alatriste or los fantasmas de goya - more than twice compared to sangre de mayo . so far , it was not possible to shoot some scenes included in the plan , he himself had signed together with horacio valcarcel , his career - long collaborator .
the difference of budget influenced the usual way of working of the director of volver a empezar : for example , the staging with the actors , with  |||  whom  |||  he often uses to rehearse before shooting together with the ones who do not belong to the cast , considering this " humiliating " and thinking that " the work of the director lies in going to the theatre and to the cinema to realize how the industry he is working for is going on . "
a certain  |||  number  |||  of interpreters , some of which fall within the cast of sangre de mayo , repeat in front of his video - camera . it is the case of michael rell , carlos larranaga or fernando guillen cuervo .
four times in the oscar nominations - winning one - garci believes that none of the three candidate films to represent spain at hollywood this year , his sangre de mayo , siete mesas de billar francés , and the los  |||  selected  |||  ulitmo girasoles ciegos do represent the spanish cinema 's younger generation , " that should be known instead . "
a siviglian dancer pays tribute to  |||  another  |||  siviglian dancer .
carmen valencia tortola , father from catalonia ( florenç tórtola ferrer ) and mother from andalusia ( georgina valencia valenzuela ) , was born in the district of triana , and moved with her  |||  family  |||  to london when three .
the life of this woman that marks a revolution in the aesthetics of  |||  dance  |||  in europe between the two wars , had always fascinated isabel bayon .
" i 'd liked to work with pepa gamboa , and she  |||  proposed  |||  me to interpret this character . it seemed to me incredible . "
the staging includes two outstanding contributions : that of miguel poveda , who will sing again isabel in one of the shows , the same he did in " la puerta abierta " , and the master matilde coral , which exceptionally wanted to work together with a  |||  former  |||  student of hers .
i 'm very happy she  |||  accepted  |||  to play in my work and i feel very honoured for this . "
this work also tell something of this woman 's life because it was mainly held in distant places , particularly for her time , such as india ,  |||  united  |||  states or russia , as well as the whole europe , using her to reside in london .
" i wanted to  |||  remember  |||  her , because i think she was one of that women who had an enormous influence in a specific historical period . nowadays nobody remembers of her and even considers her work as something of value " supports bayon .
the show will be on stage  |||  starting  |||  from today , 20. 30pm , at the theatre lope de vega .
so far , the " 3 years anniversary of zenobia and juan ramon " ends with the second edition of this work , with the international congress  |||  held  |||  in new york , the restoration of the house - museum of the nobel prized and the travelling exhibition " juan ramón jiménez : aquel chop de luz " , which was inaugurated last may and , after having touched the various provinces of andalusia , is expected to be brought to new york in conjunction with the international congress .
we like  |||  america  |||  a bit less without paul newman
" sometimes god creates  |||  perfect  |||  people .
|||  paul  |||  newman was one of those . "
the sentence is by sally field , who worked with him in " ausencia de malicia " and gives the feeling of american cinema 's impotence , and  |||  throughout  |||  america , facing the shock that newman has gone .
" sometimes your feelings go far beyond any word , and now i  |||  lost  |||  a great friend , " cried robert redford , " my life and my country improved quite a lot thanks to his existence . "
when  |||  times  |||  are so difficult , men so less virtuous and with very few beings admired by people , you have not to be luis cernuda to love paul newman .
for all people he embodied the platonic ideal of beauty and  |||  truth  |||  .
the wave of  |||  admiration  |||  went beyond hollywood , independently from nationality or passport .
another english man , sam mendes , a director who won the oscar , said that  |||  working  |||  with newman was nothing less than the highest peak of his career .
the bad boy arrived from australia , russell crowe , arrived to define paul newman as his  |||  biggest  |||  inspiration .
" he left an example of the highest level for all of us , " notes george clooney , perhaps one of the few who try to live today as paul newman did : maintaining in high consideration the need for rectitude and having a serious private life ,  |||  away  |||  from the cameras .
this is not always easy or possible in contemporary  |||  media  |||  jungle .
however , some people will try and  |||  paul  |||  newman will remain a very good example to get them inspired .
after the divorce , his second marriage with joanne woodward lasted fifty years long , and he remained faithful having  |||  certainly  |||  opportunities for not being so .
in the sky he is accompanied by the pride of his daughters who are also his fans on the earth , something not so common in  |||  america  |||  .
" of all the  |||  major  |||  roles he interpreted , none he was so proud of than that of devoted husband , loving father , attentive grandfather and passionate philanthropist " they say .
the imperfect race of an olympic  |||  madrid  |||
yes , the dream of many of us is that one day olympics will be  |||  held  |||  in madrid and , after the failed attempt in 2012 , this could happen in 2016 .
but i wonder , are we  |||  ready  |||  ?
if we  |||  follow  |||  the example of yesterday race , i just say no !
they called it the "  |||  perfect  |||  race " but in my opinion it was by far the worst i witnessed .
but let 's go with order and  |||  start  |||  from the very beginning .
the nonsense began with the collection of the back  |||  number  |||  , which presupposed you went there before the race .
it did not seem a bad idea , but if you 're forced to go , it should be to withdraw all things ( including the chip to  |||  avoid  |||  queues during the race ) .
we went there just to collect the back  |||  number  |||  ( first nonsense , just go for this only reason ) and ( after the queue ) , surprise ! they only had " s " size t - shirts ( second nonsense , because i need an xl ) .
is it to blame the crisis if they bought only  |||  small  |||  t - shirts , made with smaller tissue and therefore less expensive ?
well , these things were nothing if compared with the day of the  |||  race  |||  .
we had to go very  |||  early  |||  to collect the chip but the queue was 15 minutes long and , furthermore , you had to deposit your backpack .
the wait lasted more than 35 minutes , something incomprehensible for a race where you  |||  expect  |||  more than 11,000 people .
then , as expected , the race  |||  started  |||  when we had not even handed over the backpack , although , once succeeded , the recovery was even worse .
i believe we will be around 500 people surely with pneumonia tomorrow , and some , like me , not even resulted in the  |||  proper  |||  arrival order because of the chip , which , i suppose , did not record the arrival time properly .
in future , if i will be asked for the  |||  perfect  |||  race , this one wont't certainly enter in my thoughts .
microsoft looks for a (  |||  virtual  |||  ) receptionist
thanks to a camera and a forms and faces ' recognition system , this " receptionist " may know how many people are there in a specific room , who are they -- including  |||  remember  |||  what 's their position - and listen and understand the keywords in a conversation with them .
the demo showed that the receptionist notes a third person , understands he does not belong to the group he is  |||  talking  |||  with and that he is not a company 's employee .
but this is the  |||  future  |||  , of course .
this week it was a big  |||  talk  |||  on microsoft 's change of strategy .
windows 7 will be lighter and will not be charged with so many  |||  programs  |||  .
steve ballmer has discovered that if computers are equipped with the essential functions and less  |||  commercial  |||  rubbish , these should be five times faster - hey ! steve , will be for less .
a real discovery , if one takes into account the fact that microsoft , version after version has only added  |||  features  |||  and " extras " to windows .
the change of  |||  direction  |||  is very welcome .
microsoft is right : the  |||  operating  |||  system will be increasingly losing importance , and the software with it .
many rightly pointed out that a  |||  browser  |||  is not an operating system .
it performs the same function of your  |||  wife  |||  or your husband when you have something to say to your mother - in - law .
it 's  |||  true  |||  .
it wo n't ever disappear , perhaps you just need to think about the " death " of the  |||  operating  |||  system as a relative event rather than as an absolute one .
what ballmer said this week confirms this  |||  idea  |||  .
they only use the computer to launch explorer or firefox - or chrome - daily and  |||  spend  |||  a longer time browsing the web rather than working in a window environment .
|||  less  |||  is more .
and windows 7 should be  |||  less  |||  , much less than vista .
less heavy , less loaded , less  |||  complex  |||  .
actually , they desperately need it . let 's take a  |||  little  |||  example .
i shot the photo of this post during the microsoft employees ' break , in redmond ,  |||  earlier  |||  this month .
a sign , hanging on the soft drinks ' machine suggested them to use the company 's search engine - " your  |||  search  |||  . our future " .
in 2006 , an  |||  independent  |||  study reached the conclusion that the 66 % of microsoft employees used google to search on the net .
last week , moreover , microsoft confirmed the  |||  delay  |||  in developing the new version of windows mobile 7 .
microsoft  |||  surely  |||  will try a joint launch , windows 7 and windows mobile 7 together .
but the  |||  delay  |||  , with android and the iphone already on marketing , will result detrimental .
pablo picasso used to dress it while in the french riviera , leonardo di caprio shone with one of this in ' diamante de sangre ' by edward zwick , as well as al pacino in ' the godfather ' of francis ford coppola . moreover , it is  |||  part  |||  of the typical uniform worn by the muscular gay parish .
it is the ' tank ' , as english speakers call it , though , the brussels fabuleux marcel stands out  |||  above  |||  all .
first of all , this is due to its grandiose  |||  name  |||  - even if it is commonly known just as " marcel " - name that has something to do with the sport because it derives , according to the legend , from the boxer marcel cerdan , who loved the singer edith piaf .
the " marcel " excels - if compared to the  |||  others  |||  - for its high quality cotton , for its unisex cutting , for his distinctive little shield and the small belgian flag ( barely recognizable ) , which the most emblematic models keep as a detail on the neck .
and open your eyes ! , because the belgian  |||  company  |||  does not produce only its famous " tank " .
the great resemblance with her sister has not prevented her from  |||  developing  |||  a strong personality .
monica cruz is a tiny woman , but still ,  |||  full  |||  of vitality .
i came here to  |||  present  |||  the new collection my sister penelope and i have designed for the new mango autumn - winter season , to join the second edition of ' mango fashion awards ' and the opera dinner in honour of valentino .
what is the inspiration of your new collection for mango in this  |||  fourth  |||  season of work for the spanish fashion house ?
dancer , actress and designer , you 're a very versatile  |||  woman  |||  , are n't you ?
it was so good ! , much  |||  better  |||  than going to the amusement park .
it is known dancers really like to have their own style when going to class and dance recitals , to look themselves in the mirror and  |||  feel  |||  good .
and in the actress role , when you are delivered the wardrobe , this is the time you  |||  actually  |||  encounter the character .
so , everything goes together , yes , with a lot of  |||  respect  |||  for designers and professionals .
i 'm not scared by the  |||  biological  |||  clock .
yes , of course , i 'm . i know it is my same  |||  body  |||  pushing me for this and also i want to be a young mom , i 'm not gonna miss it .
i will give my son a lot of happiness and i will educate him with bigger  |||  love  |||  .
talking about cinema , you are waiting the release of some films you acted  |||  last year  |||  .
|||  coming  |||  from the theatrical experience , i am a very impatient and anxious woman , i want everything now and clearly , but i know this may not be always possible .
people usually ignore this naomi 's tender  |||  heart  |||  .
it is said so many things on her , that , knowing her quite well , i can assure you are not  |||  true  |||  .
you cannot back out of helping the third  |||  world  |||  women .
drivers reticent of alcoholism should  |||  install  |||  the ' alcolock '
the interior office wants the driver under three administrative  |||  penalties  |||  for excessive alcoholic rate , to install in their car a system that prevents driving the vehicle when drunk . the same if you do not blow into the measuring device .
the measure was announced last june and has been already  |||  included  |||  in the annual report of the state attorney general , according to which it will be a pilot project for a period of one year .
this project 's goal is the reinstatement of the driver , since he will need to attend a course of  |||  road  |||  re - education .
the initiative is supported by the attorney general for road safety , together with the  |||  general  |||  directorate of traffic ( dgt ) and the technological institute foundation for security in the automobile ( fits ) .
according to  |||  statistics  |||  , between 30 % and 75 % of drivers fined more than once for drunk driving , still drive a car .
the ' alcolock ' would avoid this , because the device ,  |||  connected  |||  to the vehicle , measures the rate of alcohol in breath and prevents the driver from getting the car if he does not blow inside it , or in case it detects in the car an higher alcoholic concentration than permitted by law .
the  |||  cost  |||  of the device , a bit more than 1000 euro , should be charged to the sanctioned .
and in spain it was estimated it could  |||  save  |||  around 115 lives in one year .
the measure is  |||  limited  |||  to administrative sanctions for two reasons : first of all to stop these behaviors before they turn into criminal offenses .
and second , to facilitate the implementation of this practice , as the legal reform can be ordinarily made , but , on the contrary , the  |||  necessary  |||  reform of the criminal procedure requires to go through an organic law .
the device is not yet available on the  |||  spanish  |||  market in any commercial solution , even if it has already been introduced on an experimental basis in some trucks and public transports .
just tomorrow , the congress of deputies will vote a psoe 's initiative by which the party proposes to install the system in  |||  school  |||  buses , as has already been done in france .
in line with the  |||  british  |||  punctuality , at 17.40 pm , perfectly on schedule , the spanish airline landed at the presidential hangar of benito juárez airport in mexico city , bringing there the prices of asturias .
the  |||  spanish  |||  ambassador and other authorities stood at the foot of the ladder .
a few hours before i had asked a taxi driver , along the street , if he knew that the  |||  spanish  |||  princes were about visiting the city to formalize an official travel .
- ah , very good , so we cannot go to the  |||  airport  |||  and collect people in that time band ... is she from here or ...
many are those who wait for them at the airport 's hangar , crowded together on the red carpet and closed to a  |||  military  |||  line composed by 27 navy soldiers offering the honour greeting .
the best fashion  |||  award  |||
probably there is not a more  |||  appropriate  |||  place in the world than paris to present a fashion award , and probably there is not a living designer as exquisite as valentino .
mango has just presented the  |||  second  |||  edition of el botón - mango fashion awards , to support the international promotion of new talents in the fashion field .
it offers a prize of 300,000  |||  euros  |||  .
yesterday , sandrina fasoli , the belgian winner of the first edition , looked at his drawings in the mango 's window at the  |||  number  |||  54 of boulevard haussmann -- paris , and was almost crying for emotion .
moreover , the company 's store is the second largest in europe , recently  |||  opened  |||  on 1335 square meters ' space .
the most important one is  |||  located  |||  in london .
the proximity of the most exquisite paintings by chagal made the presidential gala  |||  table  |||  prepared by mango even more spectacular .
nati , with a broken  |||  heart  |||  and making a virtue of necessity , because of the recent death of her brother , wore a dress of the company and fashion complements by elah that took your breath away . so , arm in arm with her son luis - a two meters height boy - accompanied valentino to the presidency of the tribute dinner she had organized .
monica cruz , who ran the shop in trousers and shirt - designed by herself -- changed her dress for the dinner , wearing a very sensual long black dress . she got very excited when , during the night walk inside the opera house , accompanied by goya toledo , we were  |||  shown  |||  the room for dance recitals , and recalling other times , she grabbed a bar and outlined a " grand plie " .
next morning we welcomed the presence of olivier martinez - another boy who likes moving by motorbike - and john travolta , who arrived at the intercontinental hotel of paris , bringing his own sheets , towels and only after  |||  asking  |||  to have no smells in his room .
stars under the starlit  |||  paris  |||  sky .
1001 , the  |||  number  |||  anti - stress
it is not 1000 but 1000 and 1 the way to forget the chaotic and hectic everyday  |||  life  |||  .
and if it seems not enough , all these ways have been collected in a book which will bring the  |||  relax  |||  to the bookstores by the 30th of september .
the alarm clock is almost a punishment when ringing  |||  every  |||  morning at 7 o'clock , but the worst is imaging yourself involved in the frantic pace dictated by modern life .
office means tension , computer  |||  back  |||  pain .
|||  stress  |||  is the illness of the twenty - first century .
however , you are offered now neither one nor two ways to  |||  combat  |||  daily exhaustion and the struggle in taking a proper distance from the work 's dimension ,
but no more no  |||  less  |||  than 1001 ways .
|||  beyond  |||  yoga positions , the classic massage or the " spa " treatments , susannah marriott collects in the pages of her book , a " menu " full of options tailored to individual tastes and needs .
if someone believes winning the peace in areas such as  |||  business  |||  or personal relationships is not possible , this " manual " denies that belief .
it also suggests alternatives , such as staying in touch with  |||  nature  |||  , or provides 100 % natural recipes that help to relax .
if the adrenaline is not already flowing in your veins to produce the balance of the body and stress has become a major problem for you , it 's time to sit on the couch , turn off your mind and  |||  focus  |||  on reading .
|||  speaking  |||  while sleeping
some children  |||  speak  |||  during the night .
i am not referring to those who wake up very agitated to tell us something happened to them the day before , but those children who  |||  talk  |||  while asleep .
this is a benign alteration of  |||  sleep  |||  , defined somniloquy .
it is a quite common phenomenon , especially in  |||  children  |||  and adolescents .
there is not a single  |||  reason  |||  to explain the presence of somniloquy .
sometimes it should be linked to other sleep  |||  disorders  |||  such as nightmares , night fears , nocturnal enuresis ( do pee in bed ) , or sleepwalking , but it is not necessarily the case .
as mentioned above , it may be associated with stages of very  |||  high  |||  fever , in situations of stress or over excitement .
in any case , this  |||  phenomenon  |||  is not researched that well .
it may happen a person speaks with a very quiet tone of voice , with loose words , almost in a whisper , or the opposite ( screams , cries ,  |||  long  |||  speeches . . . ) .
what you can do instead is taking into consideration a number of very  |||  simple  |||  preventive measures , such as :
try not to over - excite the child  |||  before  |||  going to sleep .
propose calm games and  |||  avoid  |||  television programs or series that inspire fear or suggest violence .
very nervous children for  |||  whom  |||  relaxing is a very hard task , need you use relaxation techniques to help them acquire a certain inner calm .
this will allow the  |||  child  |||  to sleep more peacefully .
once somniloquy appears , try to  |||  keep  |||  calm .
|||  useful  |||  tips
it is useless , because he is not  |||  aware  |||  of what is going on , and you just interrupt his sleeping .
although he is  |||  talking  |||  , he is asleep and thus , he is resting .
do not get  |||  anything  |||  , because he is sleeping and he is not conscious to organize his thoughts .
in addition , you are only able to  |||  hear  |||  what he says but you cannot see what he is dreaming about to say that things . therefore , be very careful with any interpretation of the information you get and about the conclusions you might lead .
do not  |||  ever  |||  tell your child you could ask him something during the night to know his secrets .
in short , do not  |||  worry  |||  , it 's nothing serious , just an episode that lasts few minutes .
illhaeusern ...  |||  finally  |||
illhaeusern has finally regained its path to victory on its own soil after a  |||  long  |||  period of draught .
without playing a great match , the yellow and black have  |||  created  |||  the most occasions and managed to turn one of these into the match winner .
after a first attempt by the guest captain kauffmann who narrowly missed the goal from a far shot , illhaeusern went on to take a slight lead and in turn fonderflick from afar , then with hirn from high , romain with the tip of his foot or again diebold came to tickle the dannemarie  |||  defence  |||  .
the beginning of the second half was decisive with the first two occasions dominated by riahi and temporale for dannemarie , immediately after the score was  |||  opened  |||  for illhaeuserns by marais , well positioned to pick up a ball bounced off an initial attempt by diebold ( 53 ' ) .
sarkozy meets angry  |||  fishermen  |||  .
before leaving for the  |||  united  |||  states , nicolas sarkozy is going to make a trip to brittany .
facing the display of force by the fishermen who on monday had badly disturbed the access to several ports in brittany and normandy , on tuesday morning at guilvinec port , in finistère , the president of the republic has decided to yield and to  |||  meet  |||  their representatives .
the latter have  |||  promised  |||  to accept " with a constructive spirit " and they hope he " will arrive with practical proposals " .
a presidential visit which occurs at the same time as the general meeting of the " crisis committee "  |||  created  |||  by fishermen in brittany to come up with measures of addressing the soaring prices of oil , which peaked at an average of more than 1.14 euro per litre .
according to the elysée spokesman david martinon , the president " will discuss with them solutions that can be devised to help their enterprise to recover competitiveness and  |||  secure  |||  employment conditions and sailors ' remuneration "
nicolas sarkozy is expected with determination by the  |||  fishermen  |||  .
on tuesday morning , they conducted slow driving operations in the morbihan and calvados ,  |||  causing  |||  traffic jams for almost 10 km.
the leisure craft harbour of quiberon was also  |||  blocked  |||  , but the roads to belle - isle were not blocked .
the sailors have already  |||  shown  |||  their determination on monday by burning , since dawn , tires and pallets in front of the fuel depots at the port of brest and lorient , while demonstrations were taking place in concarneau or saint - brieuc .
the movement has spread to other ports on the atlantic coast and on the channel , such as sables d'olonne in vendée , where trawlers  |||  remained  |||  docked at the quayside or le havre , where about twenty boats blocked any movement of any merchant ships .
fishermen in la turballe and croisic , in loire - atlantique , in the evening stopped the blockade of the important  |||  total  |||  refinery at donges .
those at boulogne - sur - mer have decided to wait until after the  |||  meeting  |||  at the ministry on wednesday to decide on possible actions .

with 228 votes against and 205 for , the delegates have refused to treasury  |||  secretary  |||  henry paulson the resources he asked for .
nearly two out of three republicans  |||  rejected  |||  his plan .
" this is a bad signal for the market , which saw the congress failing to  |||  adopt  |||  a plan , " said lindsey piegża of ftn financial .
" this shows how much the market relied on this plan , " she added , fearing that a draft  |||  adopted  |||  in several days time can be " too late " .
" if the project is effectively dead ( . . . ) then the relay will be quickly passed to the fed ( i.e. the u.s. central bank ) and other central banks to manage the crisis which would further tighten the  |||  credit  |||  conditions " , predicted brian bethune , chief economist at global insight .
and further accentuating the sense of urgency , " each day that passes sees the  |||  fall  |||  of another financial institution " in the united states , emphasised mrs piegża .

obama , who won on  |||  points  |||  the first televised duel
to the first  |||  debate  |||  on friday between the two candidates for the white house has succeeded another to see who , john mccain or barack obama , won .
not surprisingly , the campaign headquarters of the republicans and the democrats have  |||  declared  |||  their own victory in the televised duel which was watched by a third of american families .
the political analyst david gergen believes that john mccain 's performance , though admirable , was not " brilliant " enough to  |||  enable  |||  it to reverse its decline in the polls five weeks from the presidential election .
according to a cbs poll , among the undecided voters , who are those that count ,  |||  obama  |||  has won 39 % of respondents , while 25 % of them give victory to mccain .
obama should be able to confirm his  |||  lead  |||  on thursday with the expected good performance of his fellow candidate , joseph biden , during the first and only public debate with his rival , sarah palin .
" it would be a mistake to  |||  underestimate  |||  her .
she has good instincts nonetheless " , warned  |||  bill  |||  clinton this weekend .
the septuagenarian mccain has repeatedly put forward his unquestionable experience in foreign policy , while stressing the " naivety " of his opponent on these  |||  issues  |||  that were at the heart of this initial face - to - face debate .
" senator obama does not  |||  seem  |||  to understand that . . . " he accused several times .
an angle of attack hammered yesterday in  |||  republican  |||  television advertisements .
obama , himself , has  |||  stressed  |||  that he represented the future .
he put forward his ability to make the right decisions and to restore the image of the united  |||  states  |||  in the world .
" mccain has never understood , while obama , if " , argued this weekend , a democratic spot criticizing the republican of not taking the whole measure of the impact of the crisis on the "  |||  american  |||  on the streets " .
he did not even utter the words " middle class " or " workers " . " the financial crisis clearly gives an advantage to obama , who is considered by americans as the most likely to  |||  save  |||  the economy on the brink of a precipice .
the democratic representative rahm emanuel , an alumnus of the clinton administration , compared the " good  |||  economic  |||  instincts " of obama to those of bill clinton during the 1998 financial crisis .
reaffirming that he would still reduce the taxes of 95 % of the americans despite the turmoil on wall street , the senator from illinois also reported that the achievement of the country 's energy independence by  |||  promoting  |||  renewable energy was his first priority , together with the establishment of a system of health insurance .
cautious , both candidates have dodged questions about the financial rescue plan of 700 billion dollars ( 470 billion euro )  |||  adopted  |||  yesterday by congress and extremely unpopular .
in minsk , " have you noticed that there was an  |||  election  |||  , have you ? "
a few hundred belarusians gathered on sunday evening at the  |||  closing  |||  of polling stations in the central square of minsk to protest against the fraudulent elections .
while no results have as yet been announced , many young people came to  |||  demonstrate  |||  against the power of president alexander lukashenko : " the dictator , resignation . "
they do not believe that the regime which has made a good impression with foreign observers in  |||  order  |||  to resume discussions with the european union is ready to take a democratic turn .
the sanctions , which include  |||  visa  |||  bans for 40 belarusian officials and the freezing of assets , could be lifted if the elections are seen as appropriate by the observers .
they have not been according to the  |||  opposition  |||  .
" we were  |||  kept  |||  away from the electoral commissions and our observers were unable to participate in the count , " lamented yuri potemkin , the spokesperson for the union of democratic forces , a heterogeneous grouping of twelve parties .
" it 's a cosmetic change , emphasizes alexander milinkevich , a former opposition candidate in the 2006 presidential and leader of the pro - european movement , because it 's who counts the votes that is important , and here , that is the executive  |||  power  |||  .
if opposition members enter parliament , it is because they have been appointed , not  |||  elected  |||  .
but their entry into parliament could mean space on television , meetings in the regions , and  |||  proposed  |||  laws . "
the opposition should therefore enter the political game because " we must  |||  open  |||  a dialogue with the european union .
because if our economy which is heavily in debt with russia , enters into a crisis , and if we do not reform ourselves , we  |||  risk  |||  becoming a protectorate of russia .
we want to be  |||  independent  |||  " .
" have you noticed that there was an election , have you ? queries the social democratic  |||  leader  |||  alexander kozulin , one of two political prisoners released in august this year .
on television , president lukashenko and members of the central  |||  election  |||  committee welcomed their success .
and most importantly , it has regained the confidence of the  |||  public  |||  who had been seriously shaken by the tainted blood scandal in the 1980s and 1990s .
in quebec , the  |||  committee  |||  gélineau has fulfilled that mandate .
" in 1998 , when héma - québec  |||  began  |||  operations , only 38 % of people still had confidence in the blood system in quebec , remembers dr. décary .
the  |||  situation  |||  was discouraging .
at that time , there were in europe with the outbreak of a  |||  number  |||  of cases of the human form of mad cow disease , a new variant of the creutzfeldt - jakob disease , said he who has been holding the fort since its founding in 1998 .
" and we did not know at all if the disease could be transmitted through  |||  blood  |||  .
it was then based on one of the main recommendations of the krever and gélineau reports according to which when we are uncertain and when a  |||  serious  |||  illness may result , in this case creutzfeldt - jakob disease which is characterized by a degeneration of the brain leading inevitably to death , one establishes an excluding action .
in april 1999 , the blood of people who had spent more than a month in the uk since 1980 was  |||  refused  |||  .
this episode has shown that the precautionary principle that was applied made  |||  sense  |||  . "
in 1999 , on the market a technique appeared which was much more sensitive for hiv testing : the nucleic acid testing ( nat )  |||  allowed  |||  to detect directly in donated blood the virus itself rather than antibodies against the virus , which is what previous tests were based on .
it was able to  |||  reduce  |||  that period to less than a week .
thus , it has substantially  |||  reduced  |||  the risk that some donors were infected without knowing it and that we cannot detect them .
today , a person in 12 million is at  |||  risk  |||  of receiving hiv contaminated blood .
since héma - quebec  |||  each  |||  year distributes between 400 000 and 500 000 blood products , it will take more than 24 years before a case of hiv transmission through a blood product occurs .
" our challenge for the  |||  next  |||  decade is to maintain the safety of our products .
as recently as  |||  last  |||  year , there appeared on the island of reunion the chikungunya virus which , like the west nile virus , is transmitted by an insect in the blood .
we must be constantly vigilant , " continues dr. décary before emphasizing that in addition to a  |||  secure  |||  supply , héma - québec must also provide them in sufficient quantities .
the treatments being more aggressive ,  |||  patients  |||  often need to refill in red blood cells or platelets .
the aging  |||  population  |||  also has consequences on the network of blood donors which includes an average of only 3 % of quebecers eligible to donate blood . "
any  |||  healthy  |||  person , aged 18 and over fits the suitability criteria to give blood every 56 days , six times a year .
on average , 14 % of those offering their blood are not  |||  accepted  |||  because they have aids or malaria , for example , and if they have travelled in a country where malaria is rife , they would be excluded for a period of one year .
" with these 3 % , we manage to  |||  maintain  |||  an inventory that meets the needs of hospitals .
the shortages are very  |||  rare  |||  .
but we must renew the  |||  members  |||  of this network of donors as they get older and cannot donate their blood .
it is difficult to convince people to donate their blood , but even more so to retain them and  |||  encourage  |||  them to become regular donors .
with an annual budget of $ 297 million , héma - québec provides not only blood products , but also tissues , including bone grafts , heart valves , eyeballs and skin that is almost exclusively used for  |||  large  |||  burns .
the umbilical cord that was once regarded as biomedical waste is full of a rich blood stem cells which can be used to treat  |||  serious  |||  diseases such as leukaemia .
" a few weeks ago , we celebrated the banking of the thousandth sample of placental cord  |||  blood  |||  and we expect to draw more than a thousand per year .
we should  |||  start  |||  to propose transplants at the beginning of next year , " says dr. décary describing this program for collecting placental cord blood as very popular .
" many mothers are disappointed at not being able to access it " because héma - québec cannot afford to offer this  |||  complex  |||  and expensive program in all hospitals in quebec .
|||  soccer  |||  - impact in the semi - finals
the midfielder antonio ribeiro scored the decisive goal in the 90th  |||  minute  |||  on thursday .
impact will face the whitecaps on friday and sunday , but the details of the series will be  |||  confirmed  |||  today .
the canadian number one trio is ready for the  |||  season  |||  .
the unit consisting of alex kovalev , tomas plekanec and andrei kostitsyn led the attack for a canadian win of 3-2 in a shootout against the florida panthers  |||  last  |||  night at the bell centre .
" i am not yet  |||  ready  |||  , warned the russian .
i need another  |||  match  |||  to feel at ease . "
" he tried to do too much in the first period , guy carbonneau  |||  noted  |||  .
but i think he  |||  appreciated  |||  the way the match ended .
charest placed on the  |||  north  |||
the  |||  prime minister  |||  does not exclude calling for an election before the end of the year
once the general council of the liberal party finished , jean charest yesterday visited jean - talon , quebec city , where the new health minister , yves bolduc (  |||  left  |||  ) is trying to get elected in the by - election today .
" pushing the limits of our last great northern frontier " : this is the long - term ambition that jean charest  |||  presented  |||  with visual strength while remaining within the broad outline of the term of the general council of the liberal party of quebec , in levis yesterday .
rotating in a loop on three huge screens , were dramatic pictures of hydroelectric dams , mining developments , of quebec  |||  seen  |||  through " google maps " , maps , etc.
moreover , as a point to emphasise , the prime minister has refused to exclude that he might call elections this  |||  fall  |||  , although he pointed out that his schedule was very busy .
the " north plan " is the fourth part of a " vision " that the  |||  prime minister  |||  claims to have for quebec , that of a " new economic space " , which includes an agreement on labour with france , an agreement between canada and europe , and agreements with ontario .
often mentioned in the speeches of the  |||  prime minister  |||  recently , the opening of the north - the northern territory to the 49th parallel - had never been the object of a presentation .
the  |||  prime minister  |||  had however to explain why the north was " a jewel with an immense potential " , but never given its due chance , investment money , or specific priority in future projects .
the north contains " nickel , zinc , copper , platinum ,  |||  gold  |||  , silver , iron , titanium , and even diamonds " , according to mr. charest 's list .
this territory is twice the size of  |||  france  |||  " , " it is here with us , it is in quebec .
not only is it with us , but it 's also us " , he insisted , to better  |||  show  |||  this he solicited a national founding myth .
the province has  |||  built  |||  much by its relationship with the north , he said : the gold rush in abitibi , quebec engineering , james 's bay .
" we , our future , " he  |||  added  |||  after a theatrical pause contemplating the immense map behind him .
" this is a traditional  |||  position  |||  that all governments have reiterated .
there is a border along which there has been no agreement for too  |||  long  |||  a time and , when the opportunity arises , i reiterate this position there on behalf of government " , he said .
in this new geopolitical context , the  |||  prime minister  |||  considers occupying the territory a duty .
and the inhabitants of the territory , first  |||  nations  |||  and inuit ?
the prime minister said that the quebec government would be very careful with regard to them and that the project would  |||  benefit  |||  them , especially to young people .
two former ministers from two  |||  different  |||  parties , pierre corbeil and michel létourneau ( former member ungava pq ) , have already started consultations with thirty communities .
an inter - ministerial committee chaired by benoit pelletier , in which julie boulet ( transport and  |||  natural  |||  resources ) has an important place , started work .
the  |||  prime minister  |||  has not excluded holding a big meeting , " not necessarily a summit , " but a time when " we give ourselves a common vision . "
northern development would also be consistent with the principles of  |||  sustainable  |||  development .
jean charest  |||  described  |||  this " vision " as continuous with that of the liberal prime minister who preceded him .
this has been one of the recurring themes of the weekend , which was  |||  launched  |||  friday by a grand cocktail party to mark the 50th anniversary of the arrival of jean lesage at the head of the party .
one of the resolutions  |||  proposed  |||  to rename the central beauharnois dam in adélard - godbout .
in the press briefing , he invoked another reference , conservative as this , the program " roads to the north " by john diefenbaker ,  |||  prime minister  |||  from 1957 to 1963 .
" between us , but i plan to be there , " he told activists , eliciting from them a  |||  huge  |||  round of applause .
indeed , the prime minister , who said in april that there would be no election in 2008 and probably not even in 2009 , has not ruled out the possibility of calling an election this  |||  fall  |||  , it is what the law permits him .
he  |||  stressed  |||  that his schedule is filled up , notably by a mission to the federation council in china and a quebec - new york summit .
the weekend 's general council  |||  provided  |||  the liberal leader a platform containing the nationalists resolutions , notably some " constitutional aspirations " which passed through like a breeze : the plq in particular calls for the recognition of the " specificity of quebec in the constitution .
it also wants quebec to be able to appoint members of the canadian  |||  radio  |||  and telecommunications and that they have a veto over decisions taken in quebec .
on the opposition side , the outline of the northern plan was  |||  received  |||  with scepticism .
the pq leader , pauline marois , has brought up again the policy development of northern quebec that the landry government had  |||  launched  |||  in 2001 .
according to her , the liberal government , when it came into  |||  power  |||  in 2003 , had waived the application .
the adq has  |||  supported  |||  the adoption of the north plan by the government .
it is mr. vic toews , former minister of justice " ( oh irony ) in the harper cabinet , which  |||  allowed  |||  himself last summer to say that louise arbor was a " shame " for canada .
a  |||  government  |||  which ignores the fact that omar khadr was a young teenager at the time of the crimes for which he is charged .
the only  |||  government  |||  that , despite the fact that canada has signed the geneva convention , has gone back on his word and let languish in inhumane conditions a child soldier .
remember , for the record , that unicef , amnesty international and the canadian bar association , among others , pleaded for the repatriation of omar khadr so that he receives a  |||  fair  |||  trial in canada .
this same government turns a blind eye to torture :  |||  little  |||  does it matter to it that a young adult is now psychologically destroyed , doubtlessly forever , after so many years of abuses .
one does not yet realise , but we are witnessing  |||  right  |||  now a creeping erosion of our rights , of our liberties , and our " democracy " , this word that harper continues to brandish and that sounds hollow in his mouth .
now comes the time when there are no more morals : one can bully , torture , arbitrarily detain a canadian citizen at the whim of the head of a minor government so far ( so what will  |||  happen  |||  so after 14 october . . . ) .
a number of voters believe they will find salvation in a party that advocates virtue , law , and  |||  order  |||  : they do not see that this government has abandoned what was the reputation and dignity of our country .
free  |||  opinion  |||  - the orwellian speech barrick gold
in its september 17 edition , le devoir published a letter from mr patrick j. garver ,  |||  executive  |||  vice - president of the canadian mining barrick gold .
following an orwellian logic , it states that the largest gold company in the world brought a defamation suit of six million against three authors and a small publishing house without a penny in  |||  order  |||  to launch a " transparent public debate " .
while it is  |||  true  |||  that the judges are independent and impartial , especially in the cases of defamation , they do not seek to find the truth but to follow the law .
not surprisingly , this difference is  |||  completely  |||  obscured by mr. garver .
since , for barrick gold , the best way for it to conduct a public  |||  debate  |||  is to ruin anyone who dares to support a contrary position ?
regardless of the trial 's outcome , the authors and publisher of the book black canada will have to spend considerable sums to prepare their defence and fight , with very unequal resources , against an army of lawyers  |||  supported  |||  by the almost bottomless pockets of mining .
thus , it would have been sufficient for the mining company to  |||  open  |||  its books , records and establish a real debate , through newspapers , the media , publications and funding independent research teams that could shed light on the issue .
but barrick gold  |||  appears  |||  not to trust public opinion and rejected out of hand petitions and letters of support to the authors of black canada .
perhaps mr garver could explain how he can both call for a " public "  |||  debate  |||  while at the same time disregarding the views of that very same audience ?
in a democracy , even the critics have the  |||  right  |||  to speak .
what barrick gold does not - or will not -  |||  understand  |||  is that the public which supports the writers and publishers of black canada , does so primarily because it rejects its brutal mining methods .
the public is ready to hear barrick and judge , but on the basis of a civilized  |||  exchange  |||  of arguments , and not as part of what many perceive as a prosecution - gag ( continuing the " public debate " , barrick gold has just moreover filed a notice against the authors of black canada demanding them to cease their use of the term . . . ) .
it denies , collectively , the right to quote from  |||  credible  |||  sources and debate on the facts and interpretations , which represents the very basis of intellectual work .
if it is impossible to study and  |||  discuss  |||  subjects unpalatable to the wealthy corporations in the world in a country like canada , under penalty of repeated prosecution , who can do it ?
she has a  |||  right  |||  to reply .
the academia , to which we belong , has long been managing the  |||  debates  |||  and disagreements , and resolving conflicts .
barrick gold enormous pursuit clearly shows that , contrary to its claims , it did not want a transparent  |||  debate  |||  .
the bush administration and  |||  leaders  |||  of congress , both the republicans and the democrats , finally reached an agreement yesterday on the largest economic rescue plan since the great depression of the 30s .
in particular , it foresees : a better control by elected officials of its implementation , new mechanisms to ensure repayment of public money committed , new provisions to limit the number of houses seized for non - payment , as well as a right to look at the salaries  |||  paid  |||  to executives of companies rescued .
u.s. treasury secretary , henry paulson , the chairman of the house of representatives , nancy pelosi , and republican representative to the  |||  negotiating  |||  table , senator judd gregg , announced the good news a few minutes after midnight yesterday , following a marathon two - day negotiations .
" we have made great progress towards an agreement that will be effective on the market , "  |||  declared  |||  the representative of the bush administration , henry paulson .
" everything has been done in order to shield the  |||  real  |||  economy and ordinary americans from the current crisis on wall street , " said the democrat .
" this is the fundamental  |||  point  |||  : if we do not do this , the trauma , chaos and disruption on the daily lives of americans will be immense , " declared republican judd gregg .
the negotiations turned into a sprint in the  |||  final  |||  hours for fear of the effect another failure would cause on the mood of investors .
the deadline we had given was the  |||  opening  |||  of the markets this morning .
associated late to the negotiations , the two  |||  american  |||  presidential candidates were rather supportive to the agreement , without failing , however , to express their dissatisfaction that one is compelled to reach this extreme .
democratic senator barack obama has asked for the addition of certain provisions in the agreement , particularly those that enable owners to  |||  keep  |||  their homes and ones on the wages of leaders of enterprises rescued by the state .
" when you ask taxpayers to take  |||  extraordinary  |||  measures because of the irresponsibility of some , there is nothing to congratulate .
but these measures are  |||  necessary  |||  , " he commented on the airwaves of american television .
asked by another channel whether he will vote for the  |||  proposed  |||  plan , his republican opponent , john mccain , responded : " i would like to see the details , but i hope so . "
" the outline that i  |||  read  |||  [ show ] that this is something we will all have to digest and with which we can go forwards .
the option of doing nothing is  |||  simply  |||  not acceptable " , he said .
the plan of 700 billion  |||  aims  |||  to buy with the money of taxpayers bad debts , assets at risk and unsellable u.s. financial institutions .
it comes after a 14 month crisis triggered by the bursting of a housing bubble which first led to the collapse of risky mortgages ( subprime ) before spreading to other forms of more  |||  widespread  |||  credit titles ( pcaa ) and leading to a freeze of liquidity and the stampede of banks and financial institutions .
this is a group of elected republicans who had derailed the first draft  |||  agreement  |||  last week .
it is believed to have come out of this impasse ever since the democrats have agreed that certain " toxic " shares of companies in  |||  difficulty  |||  are only insured by the government , rather than purchased .
to round off the corners for everyone in congress , a provision has also been added stipulating that if the government had to take losses for five years because of this program , it could introduce new taxes to  |||  help  |||  recover its investment .
the new plan provides for the payment of an initial tranche of 250 billion to which could be added another 100 billion if the president deems  |||  necessary  |||  .
in  |||  exchange  |||  for its support , washington will get stakes in the companies it has rescued , earning dividends in case of profits and that it can sell when the storm has passed .
the federal government will be able to delay the proceedings on the seizure of housing attached to mortgage loans under this plan and to set limits to compensation and severance packages  |||  paid  |||  to executives of companies affected .
the architects of the plan would like to see it put to the vote in the  |||  house  |||  of representatives today , and the senate on wednesday .
despite all their efforts , it is not yet  |||  certain  |||  that their plan will get the green light .
" obviously , washington does not hear you , " said while addressing his constituents the republican scott garrett , a member of the finance committee of the  |||  house  |||  .
" yes , we have a serious financial  |||  problem  |||  .
yes , solutions do  |||  exist  |||  .
at the same time , europe has once again demonstrated the  |||  global  |||  nature of the crisis .
after an  |||  emergency  |||  meeting , the three benelux countries have announced the partial nationalization of the banking group fortis for 11.2 billion euro ( 16.3 billion u.s. ) .
the intervention of the governments of belgium , the netherlands and luxembourg had been made  |||  necessary  |||  after the french bank bnp paribas has indicated that it would renounce acquiring its rival in full bankruptcy since it has lost 2 billion euro ( 2.9 billion u.s. ) in the risky mortgages crisis in the united states .
fortis employs 85 000 people and is part of the twenty largest  |||  european  |||  banks and the ten largest insurers .
in return , we get the  |||  right  |||  to vote with the bank and some influence .
it 's just something that investors and households  |||  appreciate  |||  now that uncertain times are ahead . "
meanwhile ,  |||  across  |||  the channel , the british government seems about to nationalize another bank hit by the financial crisis .
according to the  |||  english  |||  press , the government to endorse all outstanding loans in the bank bradford and bingley , including more than 41 billion ( 75.5 billion u.s. ) in real estate loans .
the spanish bank santander has indicated yesterday that it will buy branches and customer accounts of the  |||  british  |||  bank .
the bradford and bingley would be the second bank , after the northern rock , the  |||  british  |||  government will have to nationalize since the beginning of this financial crisis .

paul newman , who died on friday , aged 83 , as a  |||  result  |||  of lung cancer at his ranch in connecticut , remains one of the last icons of american cinema from the years of splendour .
|||  mixed  |||  blood children are often magnificent .
he was born in ohio in 1925 , from a jewish  |||  german  |||  father and a mother of hungarian origin .
from these european roots were born the glorious faces of the  |||  american  |||  dream .
without an excessive ego , the ultimate  |||  mark  |||  of quality .
because in him is portrayed a country - loving  |||  self  |||  made man , a combatant in the pacific war , wounded in combat , who in the early 50 's studied drama at yale and attended the actor 's studio in new york , before triumphing at the theatre , on television , soon after at the cinema .
the same man who fought for civil rights was also the driver who ranked  |||  second  |||  in the 24 hours le mans in 1979 , doubled as a sex symbol , albeit a member of a model couple formed since 1958 with the actress joanne woodward .
the disappearance of paul newman brought vertigo to moviegoers this weekend , while his  |||  major  |||  roles collide on the black screen of memories .
closer to us ( 1990 ) , one evokes his  |||  sensitive  |||  mr. bridge , disturbed in his old age by a marriage that did not fulfil all its promises .
so many other paul newman have passed into  |||  history  |||  .
this  |||  face  |||  throughout the ages , it was him .
him  |||  again  |||  .
young people know him mainly through the cult of slap  |||  shot  |||  by george roy hill ( 1977 ) , as reggie dunlop , the coach of an unorthodox ice hockey team .
his  |||  fans  |||  met him again in 1994 in the hudsucker proxy by the coen brothers .
with a last role as the godfather of an  |||  irish  |||  mafia in road to perdition by sam mendes in 2003 , the loop was closed .
unlike several legends of the cinema who have dropped the trade  |||  early  |||  , newman has remained in the saddle for a long time , while denouncing hollywood , its gold , its splendour and its concessions .
the french filmmaker bertrand tavernier considered him , not without humour , " as a  |||  living  |||  challenge to " underplaying " judging his performances too supported .
he played though less often , in his first young roles , marginal characters : neurotics , alcoholics , bastards or desperate men , with his  |||  perfect  |||  traits reflecting the excesses and the rebellious .
as director , newman revealed a  |||  little  |||  known aspect of his modest real sensitivity .
he  |||  lost  |||  his son scott to an overdose to whom he dedicated his film harry and son in 1984 , out of decency and sadness .
among the rain of tributes that fell on newman yesterday , his great friend and  |||  former  |||  companion in arms robert redford ( they played together in the sting , and butch cassidy and the sundance kid ) said , very saddened : " his presence has made my life and this country better . "
generosity , love of life are the  |||  features  |||  of the vibrant actor just disappeared .
we saw his mug shots on a lot of jars of salad dressing , sauces , biscuits , and other foodstuffs , judging the process fairly tasteless ,  |||  although  |||  a gag at the outset .
profits from these sales were nevertheless paid to his foundation for children in  |||  difficulty  |||  .
newman ,  |||  rather  |||  than sit on his myth , has remained committed until the end .
he  |||  left  |||  his five daughters a letter containing these words : " always and to the end , your father has been incredibly grateful for his good fortune .
and a privilege for us to have  |||  followed  |||  the trail of such a lucid and generous american artist .
a model  |||  citizen  |||  , in sum and in addition .
the politician and his companions have been accused of taking part continuously and on a professional basis in a fraud causing  |||  significant  |||  damages , as well as in other criminal activities , including forgery .
according to the prosecution , they used the awarded tender  |||  funds  |||  for their own purposes and often certified the performance of tasks by fake invoices .
most of the invoices were  |||  false  |||  according to the indictment .
the selection of the companies in the name of which the bills were issued was completed on a trip in western hungary , where jános zuschlag  |||  sent  |||  istván lados .
he asked for the bill of his consumption at the specific place , and  |||  based  |||  on this invoice they prepared the invoices to be submitted to the tenders called for by institutes such as the ministry of youth and sports , the ministry of social affairs and labour and the municipality of budapest .
these were submitted mainly by istván lados and his companion , andrás őri , who was responsible for writing the reports  |||  required  |||  to qualify for the support .
one of lados 's "  |||  study  |||  visits " was to a beer - house .
according to the invoice dated 2003 and issued by zuschlag and his companions , the  |||  establishment  |||  provided food for a group of 90 people , who were members of the association biztos pont egyesület .
the invoice submitted in the  |||  summer  |||  of 2002 to the foundation called jobb jövőért - which was later renamed to együtt a harmadik évezredért - also contained several mistakes in its form and content .
the bill was issued for the accommodation of 130 guests in a 3 - room  |||  pension  |||  in badacsonytomaj , which had the maximum capacity of providing place for ten people .
the imaginative fillers of the invoices went also too far when they indicated pigal kft . in the documents . it is a company dealing with catering services but its accounting - according to the information  |||  provided  |||  to the accusation authority - did not even include the documents of the foundations jobb jövőért and hoppá .
győző farkas , director of the firm said to hvg . hu that when he was summoned and the invoices were  |||  shown  |||  to him , he recognised their false nature immediately .
and he added that , moreover , the invoice had been issued for the accommodation of 100 persons in spite of the fact that they had only 11 rooms , which did not have the  |||  capacity  |||  for so many people .
in addition , the bill included catering as well , though their restaurant had not been in function for  |||  long  |||  .
the enthusiastic bill - makers were not aware of the fact that the budapest - based travel agency that they selected organizes foreign tours only , thus the indicated hungarian transport - as a service category - did not coincide with the invoice issuing practice of the  |||  firm  |||  .
the degree of vat , which has been shown in four documents issued by hotel révfülöp kft . to the foundation jobb jövőért , was also incorrect since the service of the  |||  firm  |||  should have been increased by vat of 15 % , instead of the indicated 25 % . additionally , the employees of the hotel issued exclusively machine - made invoices , while the reviewed bills were manually prepared .
the invoice - issuers made another mistake when they indicated road transport of goods as performed activity - turned out during the prosecution procedure . this activity was not included in the services carried out by the  |||  firm  |||  originally dealing with investment consulting .
the fake nature of the bills  |||  issued  |||  to együtt a harmadik évezredért alapítvány , xxi . századi kulturális egyesület and biztos pont was disclosed due to formal deviations such as inappropriate billing format and forged stamp .
the other group of the invoice - issuers consists of those having been  |||  aware  |||  of issuing fictitious invoices .
there was no  |||  cash  |||  flow either since the issued invoices were voided later , but the organizations forgot to indicate this in their documents .
a good example for this is iván kubatov , the delivery  |||  representative  |||  of the ukrainian executive director of delta trió kft . having its headquarters in budapest , but not to be found there , which deals with fuel and vehicle trade .
according to the data of the investigation , these bills were purchased by the kiskunhalas - based  |||  cash  |||  investment kft . , which has been under liquidation since 14 september 2005 .
the executive director of the above - mentioned company was a romanian man , to  |||  whom  |||  iván kubatov was supposed to forward the company documents between 2002 and 2005 .
according to our information , kubatov admitted having issued bills to atlasz , hoppá and együtt a harmadik évezredért alapítvány and  |||  received  |||  the amounts paid .
fa - bani jos faipari kft . and jos - investment bt. were founded by  |||  romanian  |||  masons , specifically at the request of iván kubatov .
still , he could take advantage of these undertakings ; for his  |||  request  |||  , attorney zsolt szente - who was responsible for preparing the company founding documents as well - issued invoices in the name of the mentioned firms for the associations being in connection with zuschlag , namely for atlasz and y - generáció .
kubatov provided 15 invoices for the organizations in the name of cash investment , delta trió , fa - bani jos , jos investment and linaxtrade , with a  |||  total  |||  value of huf 14.2 million .
in january 2006 y - generáció and szövetség a modern magyarországért submitted a tender to táncsics mihály alapítvány ( tma ) , which is a non - profit organization of the  |||  socialist  |||  party .
they were awarded huf 500.000 each , but the amounts were not used for the purposes  |||  indicated  |||  in the tender .
these invoices were found - during the searches - in árpád kemecsei 's office located in the ministry of  |||  education  |||  .
some defendants are likely to confess about the process of the invoice  |||  production  |||  - as they did at the attorney 's department , too .
his testimony so far is not very detailed , and  |||  though  |||  he did promise to provide information on all areas of the case , he has not done so .
the psychology of overbidding : what do we spend more  |||  money  |||  on ?
at an auction , the customers tend to  |||  spend  |||  more money on a product and overvalue it .
the neurologist and economist researchers of new york university managed to disclose the neurological - economic basis of this well -  |||  known  |||  - and seemingly irrational - behaviour .
according to their study  |||  published  |||  in the periodical called science , people don not want to lose in a competition like the auction of ebay , thus they rather pay an unrealistically high price .
the research aimed at mapping the neurological scheme of this " game " with the  |||  help  |||  of experimental auctions .
a group of volunteers was playing lottery and  |||  another  |||  group was taking part in an auction . in the meanwhile , the active brain area of the experimental persons was being examined by functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fmri ) .
the participants had the chance to gain money in both games but during the auction game - in which overbidding the other person plays a  |||  significant  |||  role - the complex called striatum , situated under the cerebral cortex , was coming into operation upon the person 's defeat .
this area of the brain - besides its other functions - plays  |||  role  |||  in the " self - rewarding " mechanism of the nervous system .
thus , according to the  |||  researchers  |||  , raising the price can be explained by the avoidance of the violent reaction of the striatum .
in order to justify their theory , the economist  |||  members  |||  of the research group conducted financial researches as well .
in this research three groups were making bids against someone , under  |||  various  |||  conditions .
the control group was simply informed about the  |||  real  |||  value of the certain product and they made their bids .
as it  |||  seems  |||  , the only difference between the two groups was the emphasis of victory or defeat .
" these results cannot be deduced from any existing  |||  economic  |||  theory .
it was the neurological imaging methods that  |||  helped  |||  us to dissolve the contradiction between the two theories in a way that we got to a third explanation at the end " , said andrew schotter , professor of the economic faculty of new york university .
hepatitis : when shall we turn to a  |||  doctor  |||  ?
approximately half a billion people suffer from chronic hepatitis b or c infection . in hungary , the chronic liver  |||  disease  |||  is mentioned among the main causes of mortality .
although the number of the hungarians being infected by hepatitis can reach 100 000 , only 7 000 of them are  |||  treated  |||  properly . the reason is that many times people are not aware of being infected .
hepatitis is a collective  |||  name  |||  of different infectious liver diseases caused by various viruses .
the  |||  next  |||  sign is jaundice appearing on the skin and in the white part of the eye . additional symptoms are : light coloured faeces , dark urine . recovery can take 2 or 3 weeks .
annually and  |||  worldwide  |||  , 1 million people die of the more serious type of the disease , hepatitis b , causing liver cancer and cirrhosis of the liver .
hepatitis c can also lead to serious problems : it may result in cirrhosis of the liver or liver cancer if it is not  |||  treated  |||  .
in three groups this illness is experienced highly above the  |||  average  |||  : among people having received blood transfusion before 1991 , drug - addicts and those having tattoos .
since the  |||  disease  |||  can be recognized by routine laboratory testing , it is worth seeing a doctor if any symptoms of unknown origin are observed .
it aims to call attention to chronic liver inflammation caused by viruses , the causes of its induction and the significance of  |||  early  |||  recognition .
does it hurt less if you  |||  believe  |||  in god ?
according to a recent research , religious belief can be used as a  |||  kind  |||  of pain killer , which could have eased the death of catholic martyrs as well .
" the scientists of oxford university carried out an interesting experiment about the influence of believing in god on the degree of people 's sensitivity to pain " , says the  |||  british  |||  telegraph .
within the framework of this highly bizarre experiment 12 catholic believers and 12 atheists were given  |||  electric  |||  shock . in the meanwhile , all of them were studying a painting of virgin mary .
the results showed that the practising catholics were able to  |||  exclude  |||  most of their pain .
due to the brain scanning technology , it turned out that the catholics were able to activate the part of their brain  |||  responsible  |||  for pain regulation .
this was the first experiment in a series of research , which besides academicians includes scientists , philosophers , theologians from  |||  different  |||  departments of the university .
to be exact , a sparking object providing electric shock was attached to the  |||  left  |||  hand of the volunteers in the experiment .
the  |||  researchers  |||  asked the experimental subjects to thoroughly study two paintings ; sassoferrato 's virgin mary from the 17th century and leonardo da vinci 's lady with an ermine from the 15th century .
the researchers expected that - seeing the picture of virgin mary - the believers would enter a sort of religious state of mind . da vinci 's painting was  |||  selected  |||  because of its similar style and calming nature .
the catholics described the situation as " safe " and " protecting " which made them " relaxed and  |||  peaceful  |||  " .
12 percent less pain was reported while the experimental subjects were studying the  |||  religious  |||  painting - comparing to the feeling they experienced by the sight of leonardo 's work .
according to psychologist miguel farias , taking part in the experiment himself , similar effect could be produced by any kind of painting having  |||  strong  |||  emotional influence on the certain person , even among atheists . it is all about finding the right picture .
anglican bishop tom wright welcomed the findings of the  |||  research  |||  .
" practising faith should  |||  change  |||  and often does change our personality " , he added .
after these great results the  |||  question  |||  now is how leonardo 's or another highly appreciated painter 's picture of madonna would influence the believers ' pain regulation ?
would the sight of a quality virgin mary  |||  bring  |||  even better results ?
on its 10th birthday google can admit : it is there in the people 's pocket , as well as above their head , in the sky . google knows where people go on vacation , what kind of medical consultations they visit and what they are  |||  interested  |||  in .
in spite of all that , eric schmidt , a key person of the  |||  company  |||  is still not satisfied .
on the other hand , the sceptics who bring it in  |||  parallel  |||  with orwell 's dreadful fantasy just cannot see the essence of web 2.0 .
eric schmidt recently stated to the financial times that the main goal of google was to collect further personal information about the users . it is  |||  necessary  |||  to maintain the google founders ' original aim , namely : " to create a system for all the information of the world " , he added .
according to the google - chief , the company - after having subverted the entire world in the last 10 years - is still at the beginning of the road towards the ability of treating all the  |||  information  |||  .
answering the question concerning his plans for the next 5 years he said he would like to ensure that google will be able to reply to questions like " what shall i do tomorrow ? " , or " what type of jobs suit me best ? " . however , software cannot give the right answers to these seemingly  |||  simple  |||  questions since the available amount of user information is not sufficient .
|||  using  |||  the 2 - year - old personalized search function , users can store their own surfing histories , they can review what they were looking for , what kind of links they clicked on before . in the long term , it can provide the users with personalized findings . the function called recommendations will be based on the same logic : it will be able to offer us products and services by the help of the preferences provided and recorded earlier .
nevertheless , it has been confirmed that all the searched terms are recorded and - where appropriate - those can even be transferred to  |||  third  |||  parties . in such cases nothing protects the privacy of the internet users .
the best example for that is the concerted  |||  action  |||  against some brazilian paedophiles ; google transferred the brazilian government some information from one of its social networking pages , called orkut . the data supplied helped the government identify several paedophiles .
the users who were worrying about the invasion of personal privacy could relief back in may when google - in association with the eef electronic legal aid organization - successfully proved his right against the fbi : the court confirmed that under no point of the constitution can the fbi oblige google to  |||  provide  |||  any kind of , secretly asked information .
( nevertheless , - referring to the confirmation of the child protection law approved several years earlier - the federal government did manage to get access to 50 000 web addresses and 1 000 search terms . however , it could not acquire the individual users ' search lists , nor a  |||  complete  |||  list of web pages and keywords covering a two - month period . )
as it seems , there are controversial opinions on google . it is attacked by those who fear of  |||  giving  |||  out their personal data because they feel that their intimate sphere and private life would be diminished by using the services provided by google . thus , they rather represent the resisting group of conservative multinational companies .
one of the reasons for it can be that google - unlike microsoft - does not require identification name from its users and money for the applications . furthermore , the  |||  open  |||  and continuously updated source code and programme package - comparing to the official software giant 's practice - looks more available , youthful and cool .
if someone lives an online life , they are what they  |||  show  |||  of themselves - this is the basic concept behind the behaviour of today 's youth .
the number of those intentionally not registering to social networking sites is significant . this way they can avoid being discovered , google 's online applications from text editor to image manager and newsreader can be replaced by alternative versions that are not in connection with  |||  huge  |||  server parks and not trying to create our best profile ever .
nevertheless , critics can also find the disturbing counterpoints : the management completely  |||  rejected  |||  the employees ' objection , which burst out because the fee of the company 's kindergarten had been doubled . the daily canteen - the use of which had been allowed at any time and even several times - was also considered to be too costly by the management . however , all these are nothing compared to the fact that google bowed before the chinese government in 2006 and - according to their agreement - the company has filtered all search results that offend good taste or the interests of the chinese regime .
one of the internal regulations of the company says that new services shall not be advertised in advance , only when they are ready to be used . still , the  |||  coming  |||  months and years will definitely have huge influence on the world : some people predict that the book and magazine scanning and archiving project of google will soon reach such proportions that it will have to face the supreme court . others have fear of the health system , which has the capacity to build a complete health profile about us , including our previous medical findings , physicians and problems .
finally , the fact that google is building up a genetic database can  |||  provide  |||  a perfect base material for the sci - fi writers of the next generation . cory doctorow 's popular novel , scroogled applies orwell 's style in the description of a future where a person can be pictured terrifyingly well only by using google data .
the murderer of two was assisted by two  |||  minors  |||  in hiding the traces in ózd
" the police interrogated two minors about the  |||  double  |||  homicide committed in ózd . there are reasonable grounds for suspecting that they assisted the murderer in hiding the traces of the crime " , says the spokesman of the main police station of borsod county .
the suspect of the  |||  double  |||  homicide committed in ózd - a 23 - year - old local man - was taken to preliminary custody on sunday .
during the investigation , it turned out that the 23 - year - old  |||  young  |||  man owed significant amount of money to a 53 - year - old man .
the suspect did not intend to pay back the debt , so he drew his creditor to a suburban establishment of ózd  |||  last  |||  wednesday , where he killed him and his 9 - year - old daughter .
the police is examining the gun and the conditions of the crime with the assistance of  |||  experts  |||  .
the warsaw stock exchange submitted a bid to buy the  |||  prague  |||  stock exchange
the warsaw stock exchange  |||  offered  |||  eur 200 million - approximately 5 billion czech korunas - for the 100 % ownership of the prague shares .
ludwik sobolewski , president of the warsaw stock exchange confirmed the bid that has been taken by the  |||  polish  |||  , in spite of the fact that the czech had previously excluded the warsaw stock exchange from the group of potential owners of the prague shares .
the reason for this is that the warsaw stock exchange is  |||  state  |||  - owned .
99 percent of the stakes are in the ownership of the  |||  polish  |||  government , which plans to sell 60 percent of the papers during the next few months .
according to e 15 , the czech  |||  economic  |||  daily newspaper , the polish have submitted the best bid for the prague shares .
on the basis of the information provided by the czech newspapers , offers have been received from the transatlantic exchange nasdaq , the new york  |||  stock  |||  exchange , the london stock exchange and the deutsche börse .
the value of the  |||  prague  |||  stock exchange stakes is estimated 5 to 10 billion korunas by the market experts .
on the basis of the agreement among the  |||  shareholders  |||  , 90 percent of the stakes could be purchased .
the largest amount of shares is in the hand of the owner of the patria finance investment bank , having approximately 25 percent of the stakes . it is  |||  followed  |||  by the ceská sporitelna bank with 14.7 percent and tiger holding four s. a.r.l. with 13.5 percent .
about the financial crisis from the  |||  view  |||  of european newspapers
the  |||  leading  |||  european newspapers were describing the ever - deepening international financial crisis as " a second september 11th " in their tuesday comments .
the global financial catastrophe is due to the  |||  american  |||  president - says the rome - based la repubblica blamingly - the president was not even able to have his own party back up the hastily prepared bill which is supposed to find the way out of the depressing situation ...
some of the madrid  |||  press  |||  also blame washington for the situation .
in the  |||  view  |||  of el mundo , the collapse of the world economy is due to the lack of political leadership in the u.s.
the american financial system is at a  |||  growing  |||  risk of collapse , which will make the whole world suffer .
although bush 's plan was not  |||  perfect  |||  , now - pursuant to the congressional vote - the threatening risk is if washington does not provide any political tool to handle the crisis .
|||  world  |||  economy is hanging in the air - just at the time when one of the biggest transformation of capitalism is taking place .
" the threat cannot be  |||  ignored  |||  any more " , marks the tages - anzeiger from geneva .
some  |||  countries  |||  are still able to provide a life - belt for the weakened financial institutions and can save those from bankruptcy by the money of the taxpayers .
however , if further banks  |||  collapse  |||  , as in a domino - effect , neither the funds nor new improvisations will help .
" the aid distributed just on monday among the ailing financial institutes was more than 100 billion euros " , recalls the vienna - based der standard , adding that the worries are getting to point out that , just like the americans , the european taxpayers will also have to dig down into their pockets in  |||  order  |||  to remedy the situation .
the eu has not paid special attention to the  |||  crisis  |||  so far , which is now sweeping through the old continent as a tsunami .
it is not expected from the " savers " to wave 100 billion euros in their hands right at the beginning but it would be important to determine the situations when the taxpayers ' money is necessary to be used in order to  |||  prevent  |||  a more serious damage .
|||  intelligent  |||  car imitates the flying of a bumblebee
what could be a better way to advance the  |||  development  |||  of crash prevention technology than to mimic nature 's obstacle detectors ?
based on joint research with the  |||  university  |||  of tokyo , nissan has built the br 23c - type biomimatic car robot drive . it is a robotic micro - car that recreates bee characteristics with the goal of producing a system that prevents collisions altogether .
the compound structure of bees ' eye plays a  |||  significant  |||  role , which makes the bees able to see in all directions , at an angle of 300 degrees .
in order to recreate the  |||  function  |||  of a compound eye , the engineers came up with the idea of a laser range finder .
this device detects obstacles up to two meters  |||  away  |||  within a 180 - degree radius in front of the br 23c , calculates the distance to them and sends a signal to an on - board microprocessor , which is instantly translated into collision avoidance .
it takes just a fraction of a second to detect an obstacle , and the car robot instantly changes direction mimicking the movements of a bee by turning its wheels at the angle needed to  |||  avoid  |||  a collision .
" if that was not so , then the car robot would not be able to react fast  |||  enough  |||  to avoid obstacles , " says toshiyuki andoh , manager of nissan 's mobility laboratory and principal engineer of the robot car project .
it must react instinctively and instantly because this technology corresponds to the most vulnerable and inner - most layer of the safety shield , a layer in which a crash is currently  |||  considered  |||  unavoidable .
the whole process must mirror what a bee does to  |||  avoid  |||  other bees .
but unlike a bee , it cannot deviate upwards or downwards or diagonally , only in two dimensions and only in the direction that the wheels can  |||  turn  |||  .
so in place of the infinite number of ways a bumblebee can avoid other bees , here only the rotation function , the acceleration and the deceleration have been  |||  applied  |||  as available means of collision avoidance .
br 23c uses lithium - polymer accumulators that are lighter and have a higher  |||  energy  |||  density , which - compared to the lithium - ion version - assures longer lifetime .
according to andoh , what is  |||  important  |||  is the intelligent instinctive reaction , not the capability for data processing and storage .
the device is supposed to process only a few inputs per  |||  second  |||  and react on them accordingly .
there is no need for storing the inputs and reacting by the intuitive logic  |||  based  |||  on the previous manoeuvring data , so it allocates continuously only a few dozen kilobytes of memory .
there is no need for gigabyte or megabyte size  |||  memory  |||  .
a  |||  name  |||  granted to the expensive child
the written version of the bill on the 700 billion dollar economic bailout package has been drawn up . the draft law , applicable in several instalments ,  |||  aims  |||  to purchase bad banking loans .
in the first round ,  |||  half  |||  of the amount is planned to be spent .
" during the further reconciliations having come to an end on saturday night , east coast time , the congressional leaders managed to  |||  agree  |||  on the debate of several days , which concerned the 700 billion dollar bailout package " , the reuters confirmed .
the compromise on the package has been  |||  supported  |||  by both presidential candidates , barack obama and john mccain as well .
referring to the results of the compromise , henry paulson , secretary of the treasury declared : the programme is going to work well and going to be  |||  efficient  |||  , but further steps are still to be taken . according to pelosi , it is not about rescuing wall street but to turn the direction of the economy .
the written form of the package has been  |||  published  |||  at 8 pm on sunday , washington time , at the opening time of the asian markets ( at 2 am in central - europe ) but it did not cause much rising on the stock exchange market .
the draft legislation of the  |||  emergency  |||  economic stabilization act of 2008 will be put to the vote on monday , first in the house of representatives , secondly in the senate .
president george w. bush talked to pelosi on saturday night , then the news on the agreement was  |||  welcomed  |||  in the white house as well .
" we are satisfied with what we have reached during the night and we highly appreciate the efforts of the two parties in order to stabilize our financial markets and protect our economy " ,  |||  declared  |||  tony fratto , spokesman of the white house .
the programme differs from the proposal having been first submitted by the bush -  |||  administration  |||  with the aim of spending the 700 billion dollars on purchasing low quality mortgage - backed securities .
now in the first round a maximum of 50 percent of the usd 700 billion can be used in a way that usd 250 billion shall instantly be  |||  spent  |||  since the congress is expected to vote on the issue on monday . one part of this amount will be spent on buying low quality mortgage - backed securities . an additional amount of usd 100 billion is still waiting for the president to decide how to be used .
on how to spend the rest of the 700 billion dollars will be  |||  decided  |||  by the congress .
pursuant to the law , the secretary of the treasury is entitled to  |||  apply  |||  a combined tactic : it can buy bad loans , mortgages , mortgage - backed securities and other types of " poisonous " credits .
henry paulson declared : pursuant to the law , the required assets are  |||  provided  |||  depending on the situation ; it might be an aid of usd 700 billion urgently needed by the american financial system , due to either the widespread purchase of bad assets , or the insurance of those , or even the prevention of a system risk caused by the collapse of some significant financial institutes .
" we will make the necessary arrangements in order to be ready for the  |||  implementation  |||  of the law , as soon as it has been signed " , he added .
the directors of the troubled banks waiting for  |||  state  |||  aid should count on that their severance - which is simply called golden parachute in the overseas slang - will be restricted by the government .
the restriction of payments is introduced in certain cases only , limitations depend on the nature of the support  |||  provided  |||  by the treasury .
restriction means that in case the treasury purchases on auction , surtax is imposed on the golden parachute , unless the ruined bank director is  |||  sent  |||  to retirement .
" this is the first time in american history that legal restriction will be imposed  |||  regarding  |||  the remuneration of chief executive officers " , commented house financial service committee chairman barney frank , of the democratic party .
besides , the government will be conferred with the right of holding acquisition , this way taxpayers ' risk will reduce , since they  |||  might  |||  even profit from the issue as soon as both the economy and the rescued bank is recovered .
the bill includes that the president is obliged to submit a proposal to the congress within the next 5 years , which specifies how the  |||  expected  |||  losses will be returned to the taxpayers from the financial sector .
sceptics gave voice for their doubts  |||  regarding  |||  the plan on both sides , too .
" this is not what american citizens expect from us , this will not protect taxpayers ' dollars " ,  |||  stated  |||  republican representative darrell issa from california .
his democratic colleague , mary kaptur declared the arrangements have been encouraged by the same people who are  |||  responsible  |||  for the collapse of wall street .

no  |||  visa  |||  needed to the us from next year ?
according to kinga göncz , there is a good chance that the american - hungarian agreement on visa exemption will take effect around 12th january , said the foreign minister in chicago , holding a speech before the  |||  leaders  |||  of the local hungarians .
she added that " everything depends on whether the electronic access  |||  control  |||  system will be employed overseas in time " .

both barack obama and mccain support the bank  |||  rescue  |||  package
after several days of marathon negotiations , the congressional and government representatives announced at sunday dawn : they have reached an agreement in principle on the bank  |||  rescue  |||  package .
wall street crisis and the financial package aiming to render the frozen  |||  credit  |||  market have become central issues of the presidential campaign .
both obama and mccain seem to act in a way to prove : he is more suitable than his competitor to lead the country out of the  |||  economic  |||  crisis .
obama  |||  expressed  |||  his hope at a campaign gathering in detroit regarding the fast congressional approval of the act on the 700 billion dollar package .
he emphasized that the proposal  |||  included  |||  those consumer protection passages that he had supported , too .
he did not miss the chance to describe mccain 's  |||  economic  |||  concepts as outdated .
nancy pelosi , chairwoman of the  |||  house  |||  of representatives provided the information that the house of representatives was expected to vote on the bill on monday .
haider and his party are ready to govern austria in order to  |||  avoid  |||  red - black coalition .
franz walter analyses the causes of the csu 's  |||  dramatic  |||  defeat in his article the bavarian revolution is eating up its parents , released in the internet publication of the left wing news magazine .
according to the popular political scientist , the erosion of csu had  |||  began  |||  far before the sad beckstein - huber duo took over the office .
christian socialists were doing reforms in bavaria for long  |||  decades  |||  - at the present these modern citizens are the ones who turn away .
the reason for it was the  |||  consistent  |||  modernization carried out by csu in the province , which eats up its parents .
sociologists have predicted it for 40 years but concerning its speed they were wrong . nevertheless , secularization ,  |||  educational  |||  results , the settling of germans from the eastern and northern part of the country to the developing regions of bavaria could not remain without consequences on the csu loyalty of the voters .
modernisation comes together with the growth of opportunities and it has its own  |||  political  |||  consequences .
the right wing is untouched , only the voters of the group have become more self - conscious ,  |||  critical  |||  and wilful .
what is also remarkable is that during the  |||  last  |||  weeks , mainly classical civil groups were departing from csu ; people of the liberal professions , industrial workers , people with secondary school certificate , people with college or university degree .
csu  |||  support  |||  here has been diminished to below 40 percent .
spö intends to  |||  negotiate  |||  with övp .
övp prohibits spö to intervene to its internal  |||  issues  |||  .
bzö seems  |||  open  |||  to negotiate in all directions , the greens do not wish to reconcile on coalition yet .
spö chairman werner faymann  |||  confirmed  |||  his willingness to negotiate with övp .
spö would like to  |||  show  |||  that the cooperation of the two parties is possible - it does exist in some of the provinces as well as in social partnership .
faymann left the question of a coalition with wilhelm molter as vice - chancellor - currently övp chairman -  |||  open  |||  .
as he said , the schüssel - molterer  |||  course  |||  has been rejected .
turning towards this direction again is out of  |||  question  |||  .
molterer was cautious in handling red  |||  offers  |||  .
according to him , the cooperation by no means will be successful in case faymann tries to intervene to the internal  |||  issues  |||  of övp .
whether choosing to remain opposition or entering a coalition is still an open question in the party , this issue has definitely to be  |||  discussed  |||  within övp .
bzö chairman jörg haider repeatedly seemed to be  |||  open  |||  to all alternatives .
" in order to  |||  prevent  |||  a red - black coalition , we are ready to undertake government responsibility " , declared haider .
járóka : the vicious circle of  |||  poverty  |||  , segregation must be eliminated
in her message that she addressed to the plenum , lívia járóka of fidesz , representative of the european people 's party called attention for the educational segregation since it is one of the most serious infringement  |||  affecting  |||  roma children . moreover , this is the largest barrier to their prosperity .
the high level conference has been opened by xavier bertrand , french minister for labor and social affairs and vladimir spidla , european commissioner responsible for employment , social affairs and  |||  equal  |||  opportunities .
representatives of the governments , the european social partners and the most significant european legal aid organizations and ngos from the field of  |||  equal  |||  opportunities were invited to have a seat on the conference .
" most of the young  |||  roma  |||  people do not have a secondary school qualification , and due to the low quality of the basic education only an insignificant part of them can obtain college or university degree " .
járóka also emphasized that education , as a fundamental human  |||  right  |||  , plays a key role in the enforcement of other human rights .
investing in the  |||  early  |||  education of roma children can contribute to strengthening the economy of the european union member states .
according to the representative , it is  |||  necessary  |||  to inform the widest range of people - roma and non - roma people as well - about these interrelationships .
the earlier a young roma student starts attending school , the bigger their chances will be to  |||  become  |||  a productive member of the labour market ; through the income and the taxes paid by them they would contribute to the national budget .
" on grounds of the citizenship right applied in the european union , the right of quality education must be  |||  ensured  |||  for roma people and low quality , segregated education must be eliminated " , added lívia járóka .
she also said that in order to instantly accelerate the processes of school desegregation , it is necessary to guarantee an objective - and action - oriented cooperation within the european union . to accomplish this goal , it is fundamental to properly enforce the existing and  |||  planned  |||  anti - discrimination directives .
within the framework of the " european year of equal opportunities " , the european equality summit - first organized in berlin last year and since then held on an annual basis - aims to  |||  provide  |||  a unique forum to promote the objectives of equal opportunities and anti - discrimination at european and member state level as well .
decision about defeated huber - beckstein duo at the end of  |||  october  |||
despite ignominious  |||  election  |||  failure heads have not rolled yet , personal issues are adjourned temporarily at the bavarian csu summits .
president of the party , erwin huber and state prime minister , günther beckstein may still  |||  keep  |||  their positions , the question is how long grace takes .
the destiny of the tandem which have  |||  suffered  |||  a catastrophic 17 percent vote loss will be decided by the extraordinary party congress at the last weekend of october .
however ,  |||  members  |||  of the much criticized duo pictured : they do not insist on their seats by all means .
with this they intended to appease the furious members of the fraction and the basis who were claiming personal consequence because of having  |||  lost  |||  clear majority one day after the " bavarian tsunami " .
csu had been " absolute ruler " in bavaria presenting 18 percent of  |||  german  |||  gdp for 46 years .
although conservatives are still considered the most important party in the southern province , which has key role for the hungarian economy , they are definitely  |||  forced  |||  to form a coalition in the future .
as one of the first signs of restructuring within the party , huber 's potential successor , party vice president and federal agriculture minister horst seehofer becomes member of the small exploratory team beginning investigative negotiations about a possible munich - based government coalition with liberal fdp as well as with  |||  free  |||  voters representing right - wing values .
irony of fate is that gabriele pauli , whose intervention against stoiber had been misused as a coup opportunity and later was handled roughly by the huber - beckstein duo , becomes member of the legislative assembly from the party list of  |||  free  |||  voters .
leaders of csu are making efforts on  |||  stabilizing  |||  beckstein in any way .
stoiber , who was staying in the background until now , will have an active role in the transition time , the ex - state  |||  prime minister  |||  and former csu president claimed 28th september the darkest day of his political career .
huber made some bitter comments on cdu on monday , according to him csu would have deserved much more  |||  support  |||  from its fraternal party .
other csu politicians think that the  |||  defeat  |||  is a warning to both cdu and angela merkel .
after the bundestag election due in september 2009 , merkel cannot be chancellor , unless csu , which was playing  |||  significant  |||  role in the 2005 national success , is rehabilitated through mutual efforts .
although it is  |||  relative  |||  : the wounded csu is not going to be easier to handle and the crisis of the social democrats is going to continue .
spd has achieved its weakest  |||  result  |||  with 18.6 percent in bavaria since 1946 .
no  |||  opposition  |||  representative was elected to the belarusian parliament during the sunday 's election .
according to russian observers , the reasons for this are the  |||  welfare  |||  and stability in the country led by alexander lukashenko , while organization for security and co - operation in europe ( osce ) explains it as vote counting frauds .
osce delegating 450 observers from 43 countries refuses to recognize the  |||  election  |||  .
although the 100 member legislation of the country of 10 million has been missing opposition for more than a decade , before the election yesterday joined forces of the opposition under the name of united democratic forces ( udf ) had seriously expected that lukashenko , who renewed his presidency for the fourth time during the controversial elections in 2006 after the amendments of the constitution , was going to "  |||  allow  |||  " presence of some opposition representatives in the parliament this time .
however , oesc 's monday minute sheet raised objections against the campaign during which opposition candidates were practically not allowed to appear in the media and especially opposition not being permitted to be  |||  present  |||  at the counting of votes .
" we have taken two steps  |||  ahead  |||  and one backwards , but the most important thing is that dialogue between belarus and the eu has started " , told alexander milinkevich to our paper .
seeing the results , the opposition does not plan protesting  |||  actions  |||  , rather aims to reach voters with its message about the importance of economic reforms .
" we have much trouble with this of course , we have to print opposition newspapers in russia , distribution is hindered by the local authorities , but i can still see that changes are favoured by more and more people , amongst the old , too " , said milinkevich referring to the fact that lukashenko 's regime , which considers the establishment of the social security as its most important result , is considered inappropriate even by pensioners who are officially most  |||  supported  |||  class of society of all .
" owing to the indebtedness of the country and the  |||  increase  |||  of trade deficit , the break - down of social security ' similar to dead silence ' is a question of time " , milinkevich claimed .
|||  russian  |||  observers described the elections as democratic , in contradiction to the opposition politician .
commonwealth of independent states mission leader sergei lebedev told russian news agency , ria novosti : " people believe in  |||  actions  |||  not words " , so the lack of opposition is nothing else than the evidence of belarusian voters ' maturity .
brunetta : " from now on breakfast  |||  before  |||  work "
it has never happened in all the history of the chigi palace that there were revolving doors at the employee entrance and  |||  exit  |||  .
but as from today , a new measure starts against crafty skivers , against those who clock in and then go to the bar for a coffee during  |||  working  |||  hours .
the novel anti - slackers measure has been presented today by the public administration minister , renato brunetta , and by the secretary  |||  general  |||  of the office of the president of the council , mauro masi .
" the revolving doors -- says brunetta -- are a tool for  |||  working  |||  better , with a higher productivity , higher presence and more services " specifies the minister .
" now a new season of  |||  responsibility  |||  and transparency opens .
this is reformism " , underlines  |||  again  |||  brunetta .
for masi " the  |||  choice  |||  of revolving doors is also important from a symbolic viewpoint " .
there has been no opposition from the employees , assures the secretary  |||  general  |||  : " it has been a process shared by the workers and everybody collaborated " .
to conclude , no more breakfast during  |||  working  |||  hours ; no more coffee and croissant .
a word from brunetta , who suggests , smiling , " a good cappuccino at  |||  seven  |||  is blessed " .
of rome , the minister , afterwards , makes known that " in three months the absences , by public employees , due to sickness have  |||  reduced  |||  by 50 % , that is 60 thousand more people at work in a year " .
and adds that it is  |||  necessary  |||  to make public administration more efficient .
italians , " whose wage dynamics -- explains the minister -- in the  |||  last  |||  8 -- 10 years have been double with respect to the private sector and far above the inflation rate " .
meantime thousands of  |||  public  |||  employees have united to challenge the provisions set by the brunetta decree adhering to the petition supported by codacons .
in fact , in italy there are thousands of honest and productive public  |||  administration  |||  employees that have united to declare war on the illegitimate provisions within the decree " .
in particular , at the tar the exclusion of additional economic benefits for infirmity incurred during work will be contested ; the extension of the hours that a sick employee has to make himself available for  |||  control  |||  medical visits , and other aspects within the new provisions insisted on by the minister .
everyday , in italy , at work 2500 accidents occur , 3 persons die and 27  |||  remain  |||  permanently invalid .
figures that witness the gravity of a phenomenon that remains one of the principal causes of death and causes almost  |||  double  |||  the deaths with respect to homicide .
to recall the attention of institutions , social forces and information media to this dramatic  |||  issue  |||  , today anmil is celebrating in all the italian provinces the 58th national day for casualties of accidents at work , institutionalised onto the second sunday of october .
" the worrying data diffused by anmil and the very same tragic current news confirm how  |||  crucial  |||  the issue of prevention at the workplace is " , declares the president of the republic giorgio napolitano , in his message to the president of anmil , national association of the mutilated and invalids at work , pietro mercandelli .
the head of the state expresses his " deep appreciation of the  |||  constant  |||  associative efforts for prevention at the workplace , caring for injured workers , assistance of the casualties ' families , and the sensitization of public opinion " .
napolitano does not conceal that " undoubtedly there 's also a resources problem : it 's important to invest in  |||  training  |||  and information .
a particular significance is assumed by the numerous initiatives promoted within the schools in raising awareness of the younger generation that  |||  face  |||  the work market .
it 's a duty to keep alive the awareness of the phenomenon , not give up to its serious social alarm ,  |||  apply  |||  and improve the legislative provisions .
" data  |||  regarding  |||  injuries at the workplace seem to signal a small positive trend , but this does not take away the fact that the number of accidental deaths is in any case impressive " , remarked the president of anmil pietro mercandelli .
" we do not want , in fact , that this ' downturn trend ' is translated into a reduced alertness , because it is just when the attention is reduced that  |||  tragedy  |||  explodes .
" we believe that at a  |||  general  |||  level little is being done to oppose the phenomenon of industrial injury and the fight could be carried on through multiple actions .
it is  |||  necessary  |||  , in our opinion , - underlined mercandelli -- to have more controls and inspections , but also a stronger intervention on the worker training , and this should start at school " .
" a greater effort is  |||  required  |||  -- he added -- with regards to the communication and sensitization of public opinion .
but , above all , a greater sense of responsibility is  |||  required  |||  on behalf of employers in respect of a phenomenon that represents a social emergency " .
" hence , the objective is to restore to the worker the insurance  |||  guarantee  |||  -- he added -- so that the fate of those who are injured does not have to depend on spontaneous political actions or grants which are from time to time set out by legislators " .
mp3 players under accusation , they put hearing at  |||  risk  |||
listening to music at high volume for a prolonged period of time  |||  using  |||  portable musical devices such as mp3 players could cause permanent lesions to hearing .
this is what a european commission reports , which in a communication released in brussels cites the advice given by the scientific committee on emerging and newly  |||  identified  |||  health risks ( scenihr ) of the eu , published today .
" from this scientific advice -- the note reads -- emerges that 5- 10 % of those that , for a period of at least 5 years , listen to music  |||  using  |||  portable musical players weekly for more than an hour a day with the device at high volume risk a permanent loss of hearing ability " .
" it worries me that such a large number of young people who frequently use portable musical players and cellular phones at very high volume may unconsciously  |||  damage  |||  their hearing in an irreparable way " , declares meglena kuneva .
" from the scientific findings -- carries on the eu spokesperson -- a clear  |||  risk  |||  emerges and we have to react rapidly .
what counts most , we need to sensitize consumers and make this  |||  information  |||  available to the public .
besides , in  |||  light  |||  of this scientific advice , we have to re - examine existent control systems to make sure that they are completely effective and kept up to date with new technology " .
" scientists -- concludes the eu executive -- confirm that there are reasons for  |||  concern  |||  and the european commission will now examine , together with member states and other interested parties , what measures can be taken to better protect children and young people from exposure to noise coming portable musical players and related equipment " .
it is  |||  possible  |||  to considerably limit the damage by resorting to solutions such as the reduction of level and duration of the noise exposure .
people who listen to music under such conditions for longer durations risk a  |||  permanent  |||  loss of hearing ability after a 5 year period .
this is the case for 5-10 % of users of such devices and their  |||  number  |||  can be quantified to between 2.5 and 10 million people within the eu .
rome , alemanno gives the go ahead to the commission for the future of the  |||  capital  |||
this is the schedule set by the campidoglio for the " commission for the future of the  |||  capital  |||  " , which has this morning taken up residence at its new premises behind the caracalla hot springs .
" the commission is absolutely  |||  independent  |||  and all political opinions , social , and cultural are represented -- underlines alemanno -- it should make proposals for a development plan of rome on which the political executives , which are always the municipal board and council , can rely .
there is no superposition of roles but only the will to have a place where a big project for  |||  rome  |||  can be drawn up .
in march its job will be done and it will dissolve , because this experiment should have a  |||  precise  |||  deadline .
in june -- the mayor announces -- we will  |||  present  |||  the strategic plan using the work done by the commission for the future of rome capital " .
for those who accuse the commission of being useless ,  |||  since  |||  its opinions will not be binding , alemanno replies : " everything depends on the work that the commission will be able to do and the quality of its proposals .
if the quality is there , as in france with the attali commission and as i 'm  |||  sure  |||  there will be in rome , then its contribution will be fundamental .
too often  |||  politics  |||  are overwhelmed by everyday administration and by emergencies that manifest themselves from time to time .
on the contrary , we want to  |||  look  |||  further forwards and further ahead , with a deeper perspective , working seriously on the development of rome and its future .
furthermore , the mayor of rome would like to point out that " this commission is neither a useless agency nor an unwieldy bureaucratic organisation : it 's absolutely  |||  free  |||  , it will not cost the citizens of rome a cent and it will serve to get reasoning and get involved the best minds that the capital has to offer " .
a future that , specifies the mayor of rome " will not limit itself to the current municipal borders but will  |||  look  |||  further afield " not only with the view of a future metropolitan city and its legal status as capital but " also with consideration to the role that rome could and must perform as capital of europe and the mediterranean " .
obama ? the first anti - american  |||  president  |||  . here is why ?
a  |||  famous  |||  american politician , who would like to pass off as independent , wrote : barack obama will be the second anti - american president .
the first was jimmy carter , who with his decisions decimated the us economy and had dealings ( as he still does today as a  |||  private  |||  citizen ) with the enemy islam " .
attacks on obama  |||  increase  |||  right as the election date nears .
a lady from miami has written on the web : " this person is  |||  full  |||  of ambitions .
obama is being cheeky : he thinks he can win the highest  |||  position  |||  in a country which has had in total two governors and five senators that were black ! " .
in reality , these are attacks that do n't mean a lot : they are clearly racial attacks and do not answer the electors ' question : will he be a good president ? and then there are the  |||  polls  |||  ; all of them say that obama will win and by a wide margin .
even in this case there are those who speak from the  |||  heart  |||  and not from the head .
a mississippi newspaper , deep in the south of the united states , wrote an editorial : once inside the voting cabin we know well enough to  |||  whom  |||  the american patriot will give his vote .
" say whatever you like , afterwards we 'll take care of where to put the cross , for  |||  obama  |||  or for mccain " .
there are people who swear : if obama wins , we will go away from  |||  america  |||  .
things that have never been said before now , when the success of the black candidate is almost  |||  certain  |||  .
however , in  |||  spite  |||  of all these arguments , the winning trump for the democrats is george bush .
|||  america  |||  changes .
in vietnam this nation  |||  lost  |||  50 thousand soldiers and was sent home with its tail between its legs .
in iraq 4500 soldiers have lost their lives and the  |||  americans  |||  have not been forced to pack up and leave .
yet , for the  |||  majority  |||  iraq has been the weak point of bush .
|||  whoever  |||  takes up the place of george w. will have an enormous task to do .
usa , the economic depression is being felt also by the journalists : in the newspapers it is time for cuts . and many  |||  blame  |||  the internet , " killer " of the printed paper .
five hundred american journalists have been asked by pew research centre what they think of the state of their profession and mental control as regards to the  |||  future  |||  .
they do n't feel as  |||  isolated  |||  as they used to .
the problem for  |||  american  |||  journalists is the money , the money .
furthermore the cuts carried out in the newsroom , the office where editors work to assemble the  |||  newspaper  |||  , are a big problem .
it 's a problem that needs to be resolved , according to the journalists interviewed , if we do not want that traditional journalism as it is understood by the  |||  general  |||  public is substantially diminished .
a clear but  |||  complex  |||  pessimism nowadays pervades american journalists .
six out of ten journalists of the printed press and senior executives are convinced that journalism at a national level is going down the  |||  wrong  |||  road .
within the local field the  |||  executive  |||  group is 65 % .
it 's not  |||  difficult  |||  for journalists to see where the web is going .
the  |||  major  |||  publishing houses are opening a passage for themselves towards the internet , by many seen as the " assassin " of the printed paper .
the " economic pressure " that journalists have felt has  |||  increased  |||  up to 79 % .
the biggest rift in american journalism nowadays is between those who  |||  manage  |||  the newsrooms -- that is the directors -- and the reporters who work for them .
56 % of managers at national level are certain that their reporters  |||  share  |||  their values , whilst at local level the percentage decreases to 23 % .
for some this has got to do with " job  |||  security  |||  " .
on a national level , 43 % of the managers  |||  believe  |||  they will lose their jobs within 3 years .
for  |||  journalists  |||  the figure is 30 % .
as for " job security " at  |||  staff  |||  level ( our editors , ndr ) in america it varies on a day to day basis .
only 13 % of journalists have a work  |||  contract  |||  .
in an immense nation such as the usa , with 300 million inhabitants and thousands of journals , magazines , radio , tv , and internet employers offer whatever they want and hence it becomes a question of take it or  |||  leave  |||  it .
directors almost always  |||  receive  |||  huge salaries , while an editor may earn 10 thousand dollars a month , in addition to the pension and paid insurances .
as for holiday , things get  |||  complicated  |||  : so many days the first year , so many days after the third to get to a total of 15 days after a certain number of years .
but  |||  american  |||  journalists , by their own admission , fall frequently " ill " during the year .
it 's all a question of  |||  climate  |||  .
unipol :  |||  rome  |||  tribunal , danilo coppola stays at grottaferrata
the president of the second penal section of the rome tribunal , carmelo rinaudo , has decided to reject the petition made by the estate agent , danilo coppola that had requested to be able to  |||  move  |||  from his home town , grottaferrata , to an abode in rome .
coppola is under investigation for bankruptcy within the scope of the inquiry on the counter - proposal  |||  regarding  |||  the unipol - bnl takeover .
his lawyers , michele gentiloni and gaetano pecorella , had asked that the estate agent could travel from the country town within the province to an abode within the  |||  capital  |||  .
the elite in  |||  danger  |||
a confirmation was given by yesterday 's new york times when it reported that the current crisis is causing a split within the republican party , ever more divided between its old east coast soul , moderate , in favour of federal institutions and the  |||  business  |||  community , and its new soul , instead conservative , hostile to " those in washington " and to the financial world , especially strong within the central and southern states .
the soul , to be exact , which has made itself overbearingly alive with the vote  |||  mentioned  |||  initially .
the latter is but only one example of the changes , of the big changes , that the  |||  current  |||  economic earthquake perhaps heralds or allows to be perceived : not only in the united states but also in all the west and maybe not only here .
both in the usa as in europe the crisis seems to act as a catalyst for phenomena which have been in incubation for some time and which in the new climate have solidified and are finally  |||  coming  |||  to light .
the crisis , in fact , is a crisis for the financial - banking institutions who have , indeed ,  |||  strong  |||  ties with foreign countries , but which above all deal with the budgets of persons or families who live in a single nation , in a single state .
this immediately creates a political problem for whoever is in government : and that is how to respond to the  |||  difficulties  |||  and the protests of those people and those families that , besides , also form the electorate .
political internationalism appears to be substantially out of play or to not have a lot to say : the clear proof of this is given by the european union that ,  |||  divided  |||  as usual between the various interests and the diverse state strategies , cannot decide on a common political path .
and so it is from the government of each  |||  single  |||  state that all wait for intervention , bailout and re - launching plans , new rules , and especially financial aid : since that when it comes to worst it is only the states that have financial resources , the mass of financial resources capable to try and fix things .
and they possess likewise the  |||  necessary  |||  means , and the legitimate reasons to use them : two resources of incommensurable value , under certain circumstances , of which probably no market and no international organisation could ever dispose of in an analogous measure .
paradoxically , in fact , while we were convinced that we had entered the reign of the web , of a technology increasingly more sophisticated , of the immaterial , while we were convinced that globalised finance was by now destined to dominate the world , we became suddenly  |||  aware  |||  that our future had instead to deal in an ever increasing fashion with those things that are very little immaterial such as water , harvests , oil .
whoever says territory ,  |||  state  |||  , government , inevitably implies politics , and hence leadership .
in this respect the economic crisis seems to  |||  produce  |||  two convergent phenomena .
and together something  |||  ever  |||  deeper and in a certain way disturbing : a discredit , an intolerance , an image of inadequacy , a sense of remoteness that tends to involve the entire ruling class of an ever - increasing number of western countries .
in other words , the  |||  call  |||  for leadership feeds underhandedly a branched but powerful movement of delegitimization of the managerial class and of the traditional political structures , that manifest itself in the sudden electoral " revolts " or abrupt twists in the collective moods in these last and latest times , from the conservative rise in austria -- bavaria to the collapse of the labour consensus in great britain , to the rebellion of the american congressmen against bush ( and perhaps even the victory of the right in italy has something to do with it ) .
one gets the impression that the traditional elite , their parties , their programmes , but also their rites , their newspapers , their accredited intellectuals , some would say their formats , are finding it always more  |||  difficult  |||  to comprehend , and hence to represent , that which has been taking shape within the deepest layers of western societies and which the economic crisis is strengthening , augmenting , potentially agitating without restraint .
but keeping one 's eyes wide  |||  open  |||  , it is not for sure .
superglue to be able to walk on  |||  walls  |||
to defeat the laws of gravity thanks to a super glue and in the future be able to  |||  walk  |||  up walls like spiderman .
it 's the aim of various  |||  american  |||  research centres and now a team of four institutes has come very close .
with an adhesive of only 2.5 cm squared the scientists have succeeded in gluing a  |||  body  |||  of 100 kilograms onto a vertical wall .
studying -- the american magazine science has published the findings of some researchers at the university of dayton , akron , of the georgia institute of technology , and of the air  |||  force  |||  research laboratory .
the material invented by the team of scientists is an improvement on existent materials that utilise a  |||  particular  |||  carbon structure , called carbon nanotubes .
" the principle behind the glue could be imagined as being like a series of tubes arranged like a pile of spaghetti " explains zhong lin wang of the georgia institute of  |||  technology  |||  in atlanta .
the scientists were inspired by the paws of geckoes , covered with microscopic bristles which succeed in assuring a  |||  perfect  |||  adhesion to the animal .
the tests conducted on various materials such as glass , teflon , and sandpaper have demonstrated that the new adhesive is ten times stronger than the paws of this reptile and at the same time " comes off from walls easier " explains liming dai , researcher at the engineering faculty of the  |||  university  |||  of dayton .
walk on walls ? - " this  |||  material  |||  could be useful as a temporary glue " adds liming dai .
perhaps for walking on walls just like spiderman ? maybe yes , but the  |||  researchers  |||  are thinking of a less glamorous use such as the connections between electrical devices , because the carbon nanotubes are conductors of heat and of electrical current .
other  |||  applications  |||  could be within the aerospace industry .
other research -- even berkeley  |||  university  |||  , in california , is dedicating itself to the research of a new adhesive .
in an article in the journal of the american chemical society the californian scientists have  |||  presented  |||  an adhesive composed of microfibers like hair that self - clean from the dust during movement on a surface to always maintain a perfect adhesion .
|||  drugs  |||  : never with fruit juices .
these drinks , especially consumed in summer because they are thirst quenching and rich in vitamins , if taken together with some lifesaving drugs may alter their absorption , amplifying or diminishing , depending on the case , their efficiency with consequences that may also be  |||  serious  |||  for health .
grapefruit juice has already been accused because it was thought to be responsible for raising , up to levels thought to be toxic , the  |||  effects  |||  of some antirhythmic , antibiotic , tranquilising , antihistaminic , and neurological medicines .
drugs at risk -- the very same  |||  italian  |||  drug agency had given the same advice in an information bill two years ago , alerting doctors and patients to not underestimate the dangers deriving from this mix and to pay attention as to what is drunk in cases when drugs are taken such as for example diazepam or methadone .
not only grapefruit juice -- according to experts even orange juice and apple juice contain substances that inhibit  |||  drugs  |||  .
hence the  |||  appeal  |||  of michele carruba , director of the department of pharmacology of the state university of milan : " usually , such discoveries are immediately brought to the attention of the various international and national drug agencies that then change the information slips of medicines .
therefore , always  |||  read  |||  the explanatory notes of the medicines taken and if there is something that is not clear , do not be afraid to ask the doctor or chemist for clarifications " emphasised the expert from the ansa agency .
the nobel prize for  |||  economy  |||  to paul krugman
the nobel prize for economy goes to the american paul krugman for his studies on market models and on the localisation of  |||  economic  |||  activities .
55 year old krugman is a neo - keynesian that teaches at princeton  |||  university  |||  and he is a well - known leader writer of the new york times .
krugman is one of the  |||  major  |||  critics of the choices made in economy and foreign policy made by the bush administration .
a few months after the attacks of september 2001 , in the days when enron was going bankrupt , krugman had forecasted in an editorial published on the new york times that the second incident would have been more determining than the first , in  |||  terms  |||  of its consequences on the history of the united states .
" i am surprised and also a bit annoyed by the speed with which recollections of scandals such as the collapse of enron or worldcom have disappeared from public attention " ,  |||  declared  |||  krugman towards the end of 2002 .
according to lorenzo bini smaghi , of the executive committee of the european central bank , krugman is an " economist of great value " , but also an orator with a " very aggressive style , particularly  |||  critical  |||  of the excesses in liberalism of the bush administration " .
|||  open  |||  office , here is the third edition of the " anti - microsoft " package .
today sees the release of openoffice.org 3.0 , the open source personal productivity suite which aims at gaining more users , from domestic to home users , from professionals to public administration , as a  |||  free  |||  alternative for the better known microsoft office .
after a effort lasting for almost a year on behalf of volunteer developers , with sun microsystem supervising at their backs , the new open office is revealed to the  |||  general  |||  public with various novelties : to the welcome screen and to a revisited , less spartan user interface , are added others more substantial such as native compatibility with the apple mac os x operating system and support for the new format odf ( open document format ) 1.2 , the latest iso version standard .
attention was also  |||  placed  |||  on interoperability with the office 2007 suite , open office is capable of opening documents with the new microsoft extension ( . docx , . xlsx , . pptx ) .
interesting are some functions  |||  specific  |||  to some modules such as the one that allows for the reduction in size of powerpoint presentations , useful for example for sending them via email , or the possibility of importing a pdf file into the graphics module , maintaining the original appearance of the page .
collaboration is one of the features within the applications that has been considerably  |||  improved  |||  : in the spreadsheet application several users can operate simultaneously , avoiding conflicts on the modifications , in the word processor , each users is assigned a commenting colour to improve recognition during revision .
some companies are also  |||  working  |||  on porting some of the functionalities of openoffice onto the web ( on the cloud ) , and during the next few weeks they should release the definitive product .
the italian version is available for download at the  |||  address  |||  http://it.openoffice.org/download/3.0.0/download300.html and is added to the english version which has been available on mirror sites since friday .
on request the installation cd can be  |||  sent  |||  to your home or workplace .
and there are even institutions that offer training services , consultancy , and assistance , ideal small to medium enterprises , which could create more  |||  business  |||  opportunities .
the aim for 2008 is to achieve 5 million downloads , and  |||  considering  |||  that up till today we are at almost 3 million 600 thousand , with the release of the new version it is probable that the predicted figure could even be exceeded .
even kohl tested positive , it is the  |||  fourth  |||  case of doping
a new case of positive testing during the  |||  last  |||  tour de france : it is the austrian bernhard kohl , of the team gerolsteiner , third in classification and winner of the best grimpeur shirt .
the 26 year old kohl is the fourth cyclist tested positive to cera , the third generation epo , after the italians riccardo riccò and leonardo piepoli , and the  |||  german  |||  stefan schumacher , also from the gerolsteiner team .
the analysis of the blood samples from kohl form part of those performed within the  |||  last  |||  few weeks by the laboratories of losanna and chatenay - malabry .
if the counter - analysis confirm the tests as positive to cera , the austrian will  |||  lose  |||  the third place at the tour and faces the two - year canonical disqualification .
confirming the news of kohl testing positive to the third generation epo is the french anti - doping agency 's chief , pierre bordry who informed the  |||  associated  |||  press that he had notified the austrian authorities of the positive test results .
the 26 year old austrian had  |||  placed  |||  himself on the finalist podium behind the spanish carlos sastre and the american cadel evans , also winning the polka - dotted shirt of the best grimpeur .
italy " from a country of emigrants has recently been transformed into a privileged destination for immigrants " reluctantly  |||  received  |||  .
this  |||  case  |||  proves what the new york times calls the " northern paradox " : the northern regions are simultaneously the areas where there is " most integration and most work " but also where there is " the highest anti - immigrant feelings in the country and the highest support for the northern league " .
as a confirmation of the  |||  increasing  |||  tension between italians and immigrants the nyt has also cited the incidents of intolerance in milan , parma , rome , ciampino , and castel volturno .
even the new legislation from the league that tightens the brakes on immigration and facilitates the expulsion of  |||  illegal  |||  immigrants is advanced as a paradigm of the change in climate in italy .
the rent market for  |||  university  |||  students does not know crises .
according to the latest investigation by sunia , the tenants ' syndicate , renting a  |||  single  |||  room could cost a student up to 900 euro in milan , 700 in florence , 650 in naples , 600 in rome .
" the phenomenon has now assumed a very serious trend ; up to the point that entire bands of young people are excluded from the right to study due to the high cost of living which their families would have to sustain -- explains the executive from the research office of sunia , laura mariani -- in these cities the strong  |||  demand  |||  by the students has distorted the market so much as to start a process of general increase in rent even for residents " .
according to sunia special intervention is  |||  necessary  |||  that , through a revision of the taxes imposed , the prices could be cooled down .
looking at the details of the investigation , one can see that in milan , for a bed - space in the brianza zone , 450 euro are  |||  required  |||  ; for a single room one goes from a minimum of 650 ( black band zone ) , to an average price of 800 ( lambiate zone , udine and fiera ) , and on to a maximum of 900 ( victoria zone ) .
in florence a bed - space costs on  |||  average  |||  350/400 euro , a room approximately 700 .
slightly lower prices ( 550 euro for a  |||  single  |||  room ) in areas close to the other universities ( ostiense and cinecittà ) .
in naples 300/450 euro are  |||  required  |||  for a bed - space , for a single room one spends 400 to 600 euro , with the highest prices found in the policlinico , vomero , and colli aminei areas .
in bari for a bed - space 250/350  |||  euro  |||  are required , at least 350 for a single .
in smaller cities the prices are lower in absolute terms , but they have a higher  |||  impact  |||  on the local economy .
in cities where renting to non - eu students is a more frequent phenomenon , such as perugia , there is a further anomaly : the  |||  increase  |||  of about 25/30 % of the rent price asked from foreign students with respect to that asked from italian students .
goodbye old cinema paradiso , cities cancel  |||  historical  |||  theatres
" a city without cinematographic theatres is a blind city , it 's like a  |||  face  |||  without eyes " .
the sidelining process of the cinemas , with the birth in the outskirts of large multi - hall theatres and the consequent death by consumption of the single - hall theatres within the central areas of the city , is one of those events that appears unavoidable and incontrovertible and also has all the characteristics of a  |||  real  |||  cultural crime .
frequently , it is historical places which are full of memories that disappear , " it is as if a friend is  |||  lost  |||  , an acquaintance with whom we have shared the way and many memories " , observes the director of new cinema paradise , the film that twenty years ago gave tornatore the oscar and the grand prize of the jury of cannes , and which narrated the poem of a provincial hall and the nostalgia for a way of living the cinema which , perhaps , has been lost forever .
the numbers provided by anec , the main cinema - operators association ,  |||  speak  |||  clearly : within the last five years 316 traditional style cinemas have closed shop , and the ones to pay the price were above all the theatres in the principal cities : 10 less in florence , 9 in milan , naples , bologna , and rome , 6 less in turin , 5 in palermo .
among the regions most badly hit by the closures , emilia - romagna takes the lead with 82 single - hall cinemas  |||  lost  |||  , followed by tuscany ( 44 ) , and by lombardy ( 41 ) .
and to demonstrate that the arrival of the multiplex is the most  |||  responsible  |||  for their disappearance , these are exactly the three italian regions with the largest number of new multiplex cinemas registered : 195 more screens in lombardy in the last five years , 81 in both tuscany and emilia - romagna .
" the italian business has  |||  developed  |||  in an irrational way " observes paolo protti , anec 's president , " it 's useful that new structures are built but it 's also essential that the survival of existing ones is guaranteed , because once a theatre in a city closes , not all its patrons may be inclined to transfer to the multiplexes .
not to mention the missed allocation of funds in favour of operators : the  |||  previous  |||  debit by the state is of approximately 10 million euro .
it 's disgraceful , from the ethical and from the moral  |||  point  |||  of view , that the government does not respect the existent laws .
to sustain the sector between 16 and 18 million euro a year are  |||  required  |||  " .
an interesting example is that of bologna , the first italian city that , concerned by the closures , has decided to take cover by signing a protocol between the municipality and anec , the first of its kind in italy , to protect and  |||  promote  |||  single - hall cinemas both in the historical centre as well as on the outskirts .
" it 's an initiative which i like " observes giuseppe tornatore " and hopes that other cities  |||  follow  |||  the example of bologna by putting in action other measures .
it 's certain though , that to contrast the excessive power of the multiplex , traditional theatres have also to improve the  |||  sound  |||  and image quality , because the public nowadays is more demanding .
the  |||  defence  |||  of traditional cinemas is a theme that for me has always been important : the closure of the bagheria supercinema , the place of my infancy and adolescence , was the spark that convinced me to create " new cinema paradiso " , on which i have already been thinking for the last 10 years .
i have been living in rome for 25 years , and when i pass in front of the rialto or the quirinal in national street both closed by now , there where i have experienced many  |||  shared  |||  emotions , i turn away so as not to see the posters blackened by the dust " .
the accusations that the magistrates of the calabrese  |||  anti  |||  - mafia office direct against the mayor and the deputy mayor of gioia tauro giorgio dal torrione and rosario schiavone , and the mayor of rosarno carlo martelli , who have been arrested this morning for external contest with mafia association , are very serious .
" in contempt of all judicial and moral rules , and common sense " , write the public prosecutors , the two local administrations had  |||  expressed  |||  the will to pay consultancy fees to the lawyer piromalli .
" in this way , it was  |||  allowed  |||  for the gang -- the judges write -- to officially penetrate inside the municipality easing the already vast possibilities of controlling and directing the public administration " .
the president of the calabrese local council agazio loiero does not hide that " collusions between local institutions and  |||  organised  |||  crime are numerous " within his region : " there are areas where mafia presence is stronger and more intense than in others , where collusion is almost inevitable .
however , there are many local politicians who resist the pressure put on by the ' ndrangheta , heroes who  |||  remain  |||  clean " .
at the end of last april , the municipal council of gioia tauro was dissolved but already in 1991 , and always for presumed conditioning between  |||  organised  |||  crime and local administration , local politicians had been relieved from duties of administration of the municipality .
giorgio dal torrione , the mayor of udc at the time of the dissolution , had been  |||  elected  |||  head of a centre - right coalition , after the may 2006 ballot .
he made a scandal out of it when the prefecture ordered the dissolution of the  |||  municipal  |||  council .
from the interceptions ordered on dal torrione , writes the public prosecution , has emerged " a willingness to marry the needs of an entrepreneur , representative of a larger group notoriously  |||  close  |||  to the piromalli , aligning the choices of the public administration with the interests of the gang " .
it 's an immense body , that occupies 70 % of the planet 's surface and now the big , international  |||  energy  |||  companies are discovering it .
waves , currents , tides are the new renewable sources being eyed , and subjected to  |||  attempts  |||  of development , by colossi such as chevron .
the possibility of extracting  |||  energy  |||  from sea movement has been under study for a hundred years and in the 70 's , coinciding with the first oil crisis , research was intensified .
when the oil prices went  |||  down  |||  , around 1980 , the idea of exploiting marine energy was put aside , but now the appeals by the environmentalists and the new increases in oil prices have given impetus to the sector .
the world energy council ( wec ) in london has  |||  estimated  |||  that in 2007 15 percent of the world 's electrical needs could be provided for by the exploitation of the seas ' undulating motion .
this amount would be double that currently  |||  produced  |||  by nuclear power stations .
the first company to bet on marine  |||  energy  |||  was enersis , which in 2005 has signed an agreement to construct a plant in the north of portugal .
when the understanding was announced it looked like a revolutionary  |||  step  |||  .
two years on there are more companies betting on marine  |||  energy  |||  and among these , there are companies that have always been devoted to traditional energy .
" chevron is researching technologies for oceanic energy -- a spokesperson for a company  |||  associated  |||  to the u.s. oil giant has declared to the economy daily wall street journal -- and is evaluating the possibility of collaborating with us " .
this is a significant sign , especially if one considers that  |||  right  |||  in alaska the us continues to extract oil and recently president bush has set in motion a plan for new drilling .
besides chevron there are verdant power inc. of new york and the ocean power of new jersey to travel the path of marine energy and the sums invested so far , even though they are not known in detail , indicate according to the observers an  |||  increasing  |||  interest .
|||  technology  |||  to be made ready .
experts talk about a technology still in its infancy , marine energy does not put to rest all the doubts about its  |||  environmental  |||  impact .
to produce energy on a  |||  large  |||  scale , however technologies with a higher environmental impact need to be implemented .
and the choices are varied : ocean power , for example , uses a system of buoys  |||  connected  |||  between themselves .
the  |||  pressure  |||  turns a turbine which in its turn fuels a generator .
for now there are four plants of this kind being planned , waiting only for federal approval and part of the  |||  energy  |||  could be used by a military installation .
verdant power , on the other hand , already produces energy for a commercial centre and a parking lot  |||  using  |||  six underwater turbines in new york 's east river .
the water movement when there are the sea tides  |||  makes  |||  the fans of the turbines go round , creating a rotary motion that powers a generator .
verdant has said that it has a long list of clients waiting for the  |||  necessary  |||  authorisations to benefit from the energy .
after the  |||  waves  |||  , the tides .
|||  particular  |||  interest , declare the people at the electrical energy research institute , is deserved at the moment by the potential of tides .
even though it is an intermittent phenomenon , the tide is more predictable than the wind , the sun , or the waves , and so is more reliable as a source of  |||  energy  |||  .
it 's exactly on tidal energy that states such as new york , maine , and alaska , together with others that overlook the coast , have already  |||  invested  |||  7.5 million dollars in 2008 and are foreseen investments of up to 35 million for 2009 .
barack obama becomes the fourth  |||  american  |||  president to receive the nobel peace prize
the  |||  american  |||  president barack obama will fly into oslo , norway for 26 hours to receive the nobel peace prize , the fourth american president in history to do so .
he will  |||  receive  |||  a diploma , medal and cheque for 1.4 million dollars for his exceptional efforts to improve global diplomacy and encourage international cooperation , amongst other things .
the presidential couple then has a meeting scheduled with king harald v and  |||  queen  |||  sonja of norway .
then , in the afternoon , the  |||  visit  |||  will culminate in a grand ceremony , at which obama will receive the prestigious award .
he will be the fourth  |||  american  |||  president to be awarded the prize , and only the third to have received it while actually in office .
a few days ago he stepped up the war effort by  |||  sending  |||  more troops to afghanistan , something that his critics will be stressing .
at the ceremony , obama will also be given a gold medal , a diploma , and a cheque for ten million swedish krona (  |||  around  |||  24 million czech crowns ) .
he has said , for example , that he  |||  feels  |||  that he does not wholly deserve it .
he has repeatedly said that the prize is n't for him , but for  |||  everyone  |||  who upholds the same values .
|||  nature  |||  protection officers accused of blackmail
the litoměřice police have accused the chairman of the litoměřice  |||  nature  |||  protection society civil association of blackmail .
several times during the last year he appealed against certain building permit proceedings , and has then claimed money from investors for retracting the  |||  appeal  |||  , said litoměřice police spokeswoman alena romová .
the chairman of the litoměřice  |||  nature  |||  protection society is lubomír studnička .
and in  |||  brno  |||  ?
there , it will take you a good few minutes to find the  |||  right  |||  sort of bin .
i do n't mean to imply that garbage is n't sorted in  |||  brno  |||  .
but it seems to me that considering we 're the second largest city in the country , the authorities are not showing enough  |||  interest  |||  in this problem .
brno is falling way behind in its garbage sorting , not only because people here can still only put  |||  paper  |||  , glass and plastic into these bins , but mostly because of the sheer lack of containers for this kind of waste .
have you  |||  ever  |||  tried throwing a plastic bottle into a bin in the city centre ?
no offence to mr. onderka and his colleagues , but it 's really not good  |||  enough  |||  .
not to mention that it 's no easy task  |||  sorting  |||  garbage in other parts of the city .
plenty of my  |||  friends  |||  do n't bother sorting their garbage .
after a party , i  |||  offered  |||  to throw out a few glass and plastic bottles .
but , on kounicova ulice , there were no coloured bins to be  |||  seen  |||  .
luckily , on the way to the tram , i found the  |||  right  |||  place .
come on , this is the  |||  centre  |||  of brno . is n't it supposed to look good ?
i 'm glad to see that , after browsing the net for a while , my assumptions are confirmed by  |||  official  |||  statistics .
the fact that the  |||  left  |||  gave extra money to the farmers and civil servants in the face of government opinion means that there might not be enough money in the budget to cover pensions , sick pay , or building society savings .
and also not enough for interest on the  |||  national  |||  debt or to cover international judicial disputes .
when the social democrats and communists raised interest rates for  |||  certain  |||  groups , they were relying on the fact that the government would loan money for susceptible expenses , pensions , and sick pay . " it 's just a case of postponing the problem , laying a minefield , " says janota .
higher interest has to be  |||  paid  |||  on loaned money , and , at some point , it has to be paid back .
the state does not have much  |||  choice  |||  where to find it .
for all those that the  |||  left  |||  just handed out money to : firefighters , teachers , farmers .
and later , their  |||  children  |||  , too .
although , at the cost of the state falling deeper into debt --  |||  next  |||  year the treasury wo n't just be 163 billion short , but even more .
the state will need money to  |||  cover  |||  it , and it 's no longer enough just to slightly bump up vats or reduce maternity benefits , as the government has done in its anti - deficit package .
as money has been diverted to several groups of voters ,  |||  next  |||  year there will also be a shortage of five billion for building highways and railways .
at the most , conserve what is n't  |||  free  |||  too .
this means that delaying or halting thirty  |||  major  |||  building projects and money from european funds is also at risk , warns transport ministry spokesman karel hanzelka .
the čssd has suggested that the deficit be resolved solomon - style -- it should draw on čez dividends , which are mostly  |||  state  |||  - owned , and use those to top up the transport fund .
the problem is that the level of these dividends is never  |||  certain  |||  , and they are certainly not a bottomless resource .
|||  last year  |||  , 18 billion of čez money went into the budget .
every year , these dividends are used to pay for clearing up ecological damage , topping up the pensions account , or are set aside as a reserve for the upcoming  |||  pension  |||  reforms .
moreover , according to eu regulations , this trick increases the  |||  actual  |||  budget deficit to 5.7 percent of gdp .
the budget is almost three billion shot to cover various damages owed to the victims of communism and crime , to meet the cost of judicial disputes , and even to cover  |||  building  |||  society savings .
it is still not clear if the state can get by without this  |||  money  |||  .
if we were to  |||  lose  |||  an international dispute , we 'd still have to pay , claims janota .
the minister will then have to  |||  save  |||  money within the resort or , in the worst case scenario , reach into the government 's budget reserve .
the two - billion - crown state treasury project , which is already underway , is also lacking a hundred million , and what each office is spending can be  |||  followed  |||  on - line .
the first  |||  stage  |||  will start in january .
if the finance  |||  minister  |||  ca n't find the money elsewhere , the project will have to be aborted and sanctions will be imposed , warns janota .
your next smartphone will run two  |||  operating  |||  systems
the americans are saying that , in the future , users will be able to switch between  |||  different  |||  operating systems on their mobile phones at the touch of a button .
the  |||  plans  |||  revealed so far look promising .
this is the goal of the  |||  american  |||  company vmware , which primarily develops computer virtualisation software .
this will let you have two user profiles at  |||  once  |||  on the same phone .
you can switch between them or have one for work and one for  |||  home  |||  .
it was  |||  presented  |||  last november and first demonstrated just a few days ago .
the development of new mobile phone technology is in  |||  full  |||  swing .
vmware is now  |||  working  |||  with european and american operators to test smartphone virtualisation and the sets should reach customers sometime during 2012 .
lack of  |||  snow  |||  in mountains causes problems for hoteliers
the  |||  lack  |||  of snow is putting people off booking ski holidays in hotels and guest houses .
this means vacancies are still available in the krkonoše throughout the winter , including  |||  christmas  |||  and new year 's eve .
those preferring to  |||  save  |||  money and go for cheaper accommodation can still give it a few days .
hoteliers in špindlerův mlýn are so far just  |||  offering  |||  week - long stays for new year 's eve .
the vrchlabí travel agency ingtours is still  |||  offering  |||  vacancies throughout the winter .
what we 're interested in is  |||  christmas  |||  week , which has n't sold out yet .
|||  half  |||  of our capacity is still available .
that 's why we 've been preparing some cheaper  |||  last  |||  - minute christmas breaks , " said ingtours director petr schiefert .
the vrchlabí travel agency can still  |||  offer  |||  new year 's eve in the krkonoše , but there are fewer vacancies .
nobody wants to  |||  spend  |||  the end of the year in the mountains when there 's no snow .
if snow falls on the slopes this week ,  |||  christmas  |||  will sell out too , " says schiefert .
on the other hand , the horizont hotel in pec pod sněžkou has seen  |||  better  |||  bookings this year than last year .
we 're up about 5  |||  percent  |||  .
we have the  |||  last  |||  few vacancies for new year 's eve and christmas .
there 's a lot of  |||  interest  |||  during the polish holidays in january and we usually get plenty of bookings in february too , " explains the director of the best hotel in pec , karel rada .
the omnia hotel , by the  |||  central  |||  car park in janské lázně , is eighty - percent booked up for new year 's eve .
yet the newest hotel in janské lázně still has half its beds  |||  free  |||  for christmas .
but it should get warmer again after that , said jiří jakubský of the  |||  czech  |||  hydrometeorological institute in hradec .
usa : repetition is the  |||  mother  |||  of wisdom
it 's almost funny to see how barack obama , reputedly the wisest president , is trying so hard in the  |||  matter  |||  of the afghan war to repeat the strategy of his predecessor , having himself considered him to be the most foolish .
it 's not just that in the text  |||  itself  |||  he repeatedly uses the words " just like in iraq " , but he even went as far as to use the name of bush 's declaration from january 2007 as the title of his own declaration : " the new way forward " .
while three years ago he himself criticised bush 's idea to  |||  send  |||  fresh troops to help in the beleaguered civil war in iraq as " an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences " .
the following months , however , showed that bush 's strategy , which was  |||  recommended  |||  by his field commanders , was the only possible course of action and so successful that there are no reports in the news about iraq .
it did n't help bush 's reputation , but in objective terms , it  |||  left  |||  his successor in a much more favourable position than might be expected .
he was again asked to  |||  increase  |||  the military contingent by his field commanders , particularly the supreme commander of the afghan operation general stanley mcchrystal , who even went against the custom of his subordinates to harshly criticise the reluctant gunners in the white house .
the president hesitated for three months , but failed to come up with anything better , and so at least the  |||  general  |||  did out of 10 thousand soldiers .
he managed to squeeze a promise out of europe for another 5 thousand , even  |||  though  |||  he himself was originally counting on 10 .
many doubt that this half - hearted  |||  increase  |||  will bear the same fruit as the action plan in iraq .
despite the internecine war of  |||  recent  |||  years , iraqi society is relatively firm on its feet and its leaders have been honouring the treaties .
the  |||  afghan  |||  situation is just the opposite - nobody can be relied upon and no treaties are being upheld .
in these conditions , it is hard for the afghan security forces to prepare , being so used to changing leaders to suit  |||  themselves  |||  .
balancing the interests of a variety of ethnic groups is unusually  |||  difficult  |||  due to the tricky relations between them , a fact which is further complicated by the influence of pakistan and iran .
even building an " operational state " , which is the most basic aim of the entire operation , does not  |||  seem  |||  particularly feasible .
the timing of obama 's  |||  strategy  |||  is foiled by his voluntarism .
over the  |||  last  |||  eight years , the situation in afghanistan has just gotten worse and worse , and is now on the verge of exploding .
from a political viewpoin , t it is pure irresponsibility setting a  |||  date  |||  for withdrawing the troops , as the taliban will see it as indirect acknowledgement of an american defeat .
the last nato summit  |||  showed  |||  that the willingness of the european people to take part in the operations in afghanistan is waning .
european politicians cannot and are unwilling to explain to voters what the  |||  security  |||  of germany or italy has to do with the war in the foothills of the hindu kush .
this will need answering when , according to obama ,  |||  america  |||  orders the victorious withdrawal of its troops from afghanistan .
any such solution will obviously also mean a  |||  dramatic  |||  turnaround in the afghan situation .
the only saving grace for barack obama is the fact that there are three more years to the presidential elections , so there 's still enough time for him to come up with another strategyif this one turns out to be a  |||  total  |||  whitewash .
the top management of the  |||  american  |||  bank goldman sachs will not receive their bonuses in cash this year .
instead of money , the group of 30 top managers will  |||  receive  |||  shares , which cannot be sold for another five years .
the shares can also be confiscated if the managers take  |||  excessive  |||  risks .
i assume that wall street is well aware of the broader path it has to take , said  |||  former  |||  investment banker for jpmorgan , douglas elliott .
the problem lies in the  |||  details  |||  , he added .
goldman sachshas been targeted by critics since it set aside almost 17 billion dollars ( almost 300 billion crowns ) for bonuses in the first three  |||  quarters  |||  of this year .
reuters claims that the total bonuses awarded by the  |||  business  |||  this year , despite today 's announcement , exceeds 20 billion dollars .
|||  high  |||  bonuses in the banking sector , what with the economic crisis , have become a political hot potato .
on wednesday , britain  |||  announced  |||  that it had decided to charge a one - off fifty percent tax rate on bankers ' bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds ( around 712,000 czk ) .
france is  |||  preparing  |||  similar measures .
this year , women were awarded the nobel prize in all  |||  fields  |||  except physics
in stockholm today , a  |||  record  |||  five women received nobel prizes from the swedish king carl xvi gustaf in the professional categories and for literature .
in addition to four scientists , they also included the  |||  german  |||  writer herta müller , originally from romania .
the nobel prize for medicine went to two  |||  american  |||  biologists , elizabeth blackburn and carol greider , together with their fellow countryman jack szostak , for their research in chromosomes .
the last award was the nobel prize for economics , which went to the americans elinor ostrom and oliver williamson for their analysis of  |||  economic  |||  management .
the only specialised category which nobody won this year was  |||  physics  |||  .
today , this prize was won by the scientists charles kao , for his research in optical fibres , and george smith and willard boyle , for inventing the ccd ship , which is the  |||  basis  |||  for all digital cameras , faxes , and astronomical telescopes .
all the winners received a diploma , the nobel medal , and a certificate for a  |||  monetary  |||  reward .
in  |||  each  |||  category , this award totals ten million swedish krona ( approximately 25 million czk ) .
if there are multiple winners , they  |||  share  |||  the prize money between them .
traditionally , the most highly - anticipated award , the nobel peace prize , went to the  |||  american  |||  president barack obama in the norwegian city of oslo this afternoon .
in his speech , he  |||  acknowledged  |||  that the award was controversial , as he is just starting out in office and , moreover , heads a country which is currently at war in two countries - iraq and afghanistan .
in  |||  defence  |||  of his policy he added , however , that these wars were essential in order to bring about peace , despite the high cost .
|||  minister  |||  janota considers resignation . klaus invites him to the castle
on friday morning , president václav klaus will meet with the finance minister eduard janota , who is considering resigning as he does not agree with the government 's budget for next year as  |||  approved  |||  on wednesday by the chamber of deputies .
it is assumed that the budget and also janota 's possible continuation in office will be the topic of friday 's  |||  meeting  |||  .
he claims the deficit is too  |||  high  |||  , which is worsening the public funding crisis .
the  |||  meeting  |||  was announced by the president 's spokesman radim ochvat .
according to the budget act , which klaus is due to  |||  sign  |||  , the czech republic should get by with a deficit of 163 billion crowns .
however , on wednesday , the house approved the  |||  left  |||  's proposals to transfer funds , gave state employees a pay rise , and allocated extra money for social services and for direct payments to farmers .
a bitter political dispute has broken out between the left on the one hand , and the government , klaus , and the right on the other , leading to questions about the future of fischer 's interim government , which was  |||  agreed  |||  on in spring by the ods , čssd and green party .
critics claim that the budget , as approved by the house , essentially does away with the package of saving measures put into effect by fischer 's government in autumn and which it believes should  |||  stop  |||  the state falling deeper into debt .
at a breakfast meeting with entrepreneurs today , klaus , who is behind the state budget law but is not obliged to sign it , declared that politicians have long been neglecting a "  |||  serious  |||  problem , " which is the " unsustainable deficit level " of public finances .
the only thing that could improve the situation is a strong government which could fall back on the broader consensus of the  |||  political  |||  parties , the president says .
ods chairman mirek topolánek said that it was a terrible budget and that the government should rethink  |||  continuing  |||  in office .
the vice - chairman of the ods , petr nečas , told čtk that the concept of an interim government  |||  supported  |||  by the čssd , ods , and the green party is evidently no longer working .
in response to this , premier fischer described this statement as "  |||  strong  |||  words . "
the head of the čssd , jiří paroubek , reacted to topolánek by saying that what was terrible was the deficit in the budget  |||  prepared  |||  by the former topolánek government for this year , which exceeds 200 billion crowns .
the people 's party was also  |||  satisfied  |||  .
south africans claim that the new hollywood film invictus will tell the world a lot about their country , its struggle and its victories , despite some people criticising the fact that the main roles are played by  |||  american  |||  actors .
it is a story about sport ,  |||  race  |||  relations , and nelson mandela .
the life of the tireless fighter against the racist system of apartheid in south africa and its first black president , nelson mandela , is played by the oscar - winning  |||  american  |||  actor morgan freeman .
another leading role in the film is  |||  played  |||  by matt damon .
i  |||  told  |||  him : ' if i 'm going to play you , i 'll need access to you " .
the former south african statesman spent 27 years in prison for his active role in ending apartheid in  |||  south africa  |||  .
he was released in 1990 and was then the country 's  |||  president  |||  for four years .
in 1993 he was awarded the nobel  |||  peace  |||  prize .
invictus is latin for ' unconquered ' and is the name of a poem by the english writer william ernest henley ,  |||  published  |||  in 1875 .
the challenge was to  |||  speak  |||  like he does .
the film tells the true story of how nelson mandela joined forces with the captain of the south african rugby team , francois pienaar , to help unify the country . the newly -  |||  elected  |||  president mandela knows that , after apartheid , his nation will still be racially and economically divided .
he believes that he can unite people through sport , so he decides to unite the rugby players who , to the  |||  world  |||  , are outsiders .
freeman  |||  worked  |||  for several years to get mandela 's story onto the big screen .
my only aim was to  |||  play  |||  this role as realistically as possible , said freeman .
naturally , the greatest challenge was to  |||  speak  |||  like mandela .
the actor said that if he and world politicians were in the same ball park , he would try to  |||  meet  |||  mandela , go for dinner with him , and be behind the scenes with him before his speeches .
the most important thing was that he wanted to shake mandela 's  |||  hand  |||  .
i found out that when i take your hand , i draw on your energy , it flows into me , and i  |||  feel  |||  that i know how you are feeling , he said .
for me it 's important to try and  |||  become  |||  a different person .
in the film , matt damon portrays françois pienaar , the captain of the national rugby team , which was dominated by white  |||  players  |||  .
it turned out to be a great surprise for him when he first met pienaar at his  |||  home  |||  .
despite the evident differences in the stature of the actors compared to their  |||  real  |||  - life counterparts , under eastwood 's direction , invictus has received positive reviews and there is even talk of an oscar nomination .
in the film reviews on rottentomatoes.com , invictus has a 76 percent positive  |||  rating  |||  .
strange lights of unknown origin have been  |||  seen  |||  over norway .
yesterday the russian  |||  defence  |||  ministry finally admitted that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the norwegian border .
his  |||  repeated  |||  presence at tests on the rocket has not affected the success rate of the test flights .
the bulava has generally not lifted off or has been  |||  damaged  |||  in the air .
the  |||  russian  |||  newspapers are describing the " bulava " as " the flightless rocket . "
the  |||  rocket  |||  that does n't fly but lights up
but near the end of the  |||  flight  |||  there was technical damage to the missile .
apparently the engine blew up in the rocket 's  |||  third  |||  phase .
this type of rocket can be launched from a craft which is  |||  moving  |||  and even submerged .
this makes it likely that the mysterious  |||  light  |||  over norway , caused by an unidentified flying object , was actually the malfunctioning " bulava . "
anyway , the norwegians never had any doubts that it was a  |||  russian  |||  rocket .
the generals are defending themselves this time though , claiming that it ca n't be described as a total  |||  failure  |||  .
the first two phases of the rocket went well , and the accident happened during the  |||  third  |||  stage .
the generals are optimistic about this almost fifty - percent success rate and  |||  keep  |||  insisting that the " bulava " will eventually fly smoothly and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks weighing a total of 1.15 tons .
the legendary defender vjačeslav fetisov will again play a  |||  professional  |||  ice - hockey match at the age of 51 .
the former  |||  world  |||  champion , olympic winner and stanley cup holder will help out his team , cska moscow , when they need him , and will evidently be playing in the fifth khl duel against saint petersburg .
fetisov , who retired at forty in 1998 , is currently the  |||  president  |||  of cska .
since denis kuljaš was injured , we urgently need  |||  another  |||  defender .
fetisov is training regularly and has  |||  agreed  |||  to help the team .
we just need to sort out a few formalities , the ap agency quoted the  |||  moscow  |||  club coach sergej němčinov as saying .
it 's not year  |||  clear  |||  whether or not the famous hockey player 's comeback will be for just one match .
i think fetisov is someone who can boost the morale of the other  |||  players  |||  , said němčinov .
according to ap , if fetisov returns to the ice , he will be the oldest russian  |||  professional  |||  hockey player .
the oldest of the  |||  famous  |||  quintet of fetisov , kasatonov , makarov , larionov , and krutov is one of the best and most successful hockey players of all time .
in the soviet union uniform , he received two olympic gold medals , seven  |||  world  |||  championship tiles , and triumphed in the canada cup and the junior world championship .
hyundai obliges  |||  unions  |||  . all overtime is cut
the management of the hyundai car plant in nošovice has  |||  agreed  |||  with the unions to cut all overtime .
it is because of all this forced overtime that the unions have  |||  declared  |||  a strike on monday .
this was confirmed by the hyundai  |||  spokesman  |||  , petr vaněk .
we ca n't give up on our production plan , it 's essential , so we have  |||  proposed  |||  voluntary overtime on saturday december 19th , involving two shifts , said vaněk .
according to vaněk , the  |||  firm  |||  has decided to change how it motivates its employees to take the proposed overtime .
until  |||  last  |||  week , virtually every day the car plant workers had been forced to do two hours ' overtime on top of their normal eight - hour shifts .
after  |||  signing  |||  the agreement , the trade unions will call off the strike
|||  further  |||  talks should be held between the car plant management and union leaders on friday morning .
on wednesday , the head of the unions , petr kuchař , said that if they came to an agreement on the demands and  |||  sign  |||  the document , they are willing to call off the strike .
the situation at the plant deteriorated sharply  |||  last  |||  wednesday when some 400 workers held a spontaneous strike to protest against the incessant overtime .
they were also protesting against bad pay  |||  conditions  |||  and alleged persecution .
the management responded by saying that employees had to work overtime to meet the demand for  |||  cars  |||  .
in monday 's announcement of the strike , the unions also asked that no sanctions be imposed against the workers who halted production  |||  last  |||  wednesday .
the trade unions are  |||  asking  |||  the firm to keep overtime to a minimum .
the firm began series production  |||  last  |||  november .
by this september , it had made around 80,000 cars , and its  |||  current  |||  capacity is 200,000 vehicles a year .
czech discovery : a  |||  substance  |||  which works on ' tough ' forms of the hiv virus
a team of czech and  |||  german  |||  scientists has been testing a new compound which can slow the spread of the hiv virus in the body .
the main advantage of this  |||  improved  |||  substance is that it also works on viruses which have become immune to medication .
no  |||  cure  |||  has yet been found for aids .
patients ' lives can be greatly prolonged by a mixture of drugs which prevent the hiv virus from multiplying in the  |||  body  |||  .
however , they have a number of side -  |||  effects  |||  .
the work being done by experts from three institutions , the czech academy of sciences , všcht prague , and the  |||  university  |||  of heidelberg , is opening up the way to deal with the rthe virus ' resistance .
they have shown that substances known as metallacarboranes act on the protein  |||  responsible  |||  for the proliferation of the hiv virus .
metallacarboranes are a compound of boron , hydrogen ,  |||  carbon  |||  , and cobalt .
these compounds  |||  block  |||  the spread of the virus in a different way to all the other drugs in use today , and so they may get over the resistance problem .
metallacarboranes have a unique three - dimensional structure : two multi - walled cages consisting of boron , hydrogen and carbon atoms are  |||  connected  |||  to a metal atom , in this case cobalt .
a treacherous and hardy  |||  virus  |||
the hiv protease is the protein of the hiv  |||  virus  |||  , which is essential to the life - cycle of the virus .
if we can  |||  stop  |||  the hiv protease , we will also stop the virus from spreading through the patient 's body , the scientists explained in a press release published by the institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the czech academy of sciences .
in a paper published in the journal of medicinal chemistry , the scientists describe a series of compounds in which there are two pairs of cages ( see the diagram )  |||  connected  |||  by a short organic chain , which is then systematically modified .
somewhat weaker , but more  |||  reliable  |||
the effectiveness of this  |||  series  |||  of substances against the hiv protease has been tested in a test - tube , as well as its effectiveness against the more immune ( resistant ) strain as acquired from patients infected with the hiv virus .
the effect of metallacarboranes on the normal strain of the enzyme is not as  |||  strong  |||  as that of drugs used in clinical practice , although their effect is not diminished against the resistant strains , whereas drugs currently used are often ineffective .
the unique mechanism of the  |||  effect  |||  and also of its other properties , such as its biological and chemical stability , low toxicity , and the possibility of making other chemical modifications , make metallacarboranes an interesting compound for future research aimed at suggesting new effective drugs to combat hiv , says pavlína řezáčová , head of the structural biology laboratory at the institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry and the institute of molecular genetics of the academy of sciences .
the government chairman described the ods statement as  |||  strong  |||  words .
the vice - chairman of the ods , petr nečas , said that the concept of an interim government  |||  supported  |||  by the čssd , ods , and green party , was evidently no longer working .
according to nečas , the government chairman must decide if he intends to fall back on the minority in the house as a fight against the growing deficit , or if he is to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary  |||  left  |||  .
the approaches taken by the ods and social democrats on the  |||  issue  |||  of public deficits are diametrically opposed , remarked nečas .
the  |||  house  |||  gave extra money for the salaries of state employees , for social services , and for direct payments to farmers .
the czech republic should get by with a  |||  deficit  |||  of 163 billion crowns .
|||  disappointment  |||  and futility
the finance minister , eduard janota , has spoken about his feeling of disappointment and futility , while premier jan fischer said that the government is still assessing the  |||  current  |||  situation .
nečas is convinced that if janota were to really threaten to resign should the proposed amendments be accepted , the situation would  |||  look  |||  completely different .
according to czech television , janota has made an appointment to see the  |||  prime minister  |||  on monday after the session .
at the same time , he  |||  indicated  |||  that he was rethinking his position in office .
the reason for this is his disappointment in the  |||  budget  |||  talks .
if fischer commits himself to  |||  continuing  |||  the fight against the budget deficit , nečas believes that the čssd appointees who carried through the budget amendments have no place in the government .
the prime minister should also clearly state that he will hand in his resignation if the house approves other laws that will  |||  increase  |||  the deficit , those relating to sick pay , pensions , or the amendment to the civil servants act for example .
this is a  |||  matter  |||  for the ministerial chairman fischer and the government as a whole .
ministers appointed to the ods have done nothing  |||  wrong  |||  , stressed topolánek in a text report from the usa .
he pointed out that several ministries employ people in under - secretary  |||  positions  |||  who support top 09 , which voted against the budget .
nečas emphasised that , if fischer were to decide to resign on the principle of the fight against the public finances deficit , " it is totally logical and correct that he falls back on the  |||  left  |||  majority currently in the house . "
but then he would not be able to count on the  |||  support  |||  and tolerance of the civil democrats .
this afternoon ,  |||  prime minister  |||  fischer flew to brussels to attend a european council meeting .
ods stands down at the request of the  |||  prime minister  |||
nečas also stressed that , on wednesday in the house , the ods would evidently have voted against the  |||  amended  |||  budget if the prime minister had not explicitly asked the civil democrats to allow the budget to be approved .
we do n't look like orphans , we 're not  |||  little  |||  children , was how he reacted to the question of whether the ods was not hampered by the presence of the party chairman in the parliament and in the czech republic during the political negotiations regarding the budget .
i did n't notice that my vote was  |||  missing  |||  .
more links to the  |||  capital  |||  will be available , for example , to the people in the ostrava region , as the railways are adding one pendolino to that line .
the region planning the greatest transport cuts is the region of hradec králové , with a total cut of eight percent , although prague and the surrounding area can expect to see a  |||  rise  |||  .
two night trains on the prague - tábor - české budějovice line are also being cut , and several express services on the prague - písek - české budějovice route will be  |||  reduced  |||  to just a few days a week .
one of the greatest changes is the introduction of the new direct  |||  line  |||  from milovice to prague , since people now travelling from milovice have to change in lysá nad labem .
this is the fifteenth line in the esko suburban system , which can now be  |||  opened  |||  since the track from lysá nad labem to milovice has been fully electrified .
long - distance services to the  |||  capital  |||  will end at the prague hlavní nádraží station .
czech railways is introducing more pendolino routes between  |||  prague  |||  and ostrava and trains to šumperk / jeseník will run on two - hour intervals .
from december 13th ,  |||  passengers  |||  will no longer be able to take pendolino to bratislava .
express trains are ordered and  |||  paid  |||  for by the ministry of transport , and next year it will give the railways four billion crowns to cover demonstrable losses , the same amount as this year . local trains are ordered by the regional authorities , who , next year , will pay out a total of eight billion crowns for them , while almost three billion will be contributed by the state .
this year , regional trains are costing 200  |||  million  |||  more .
czech railways have  |||  concluded  |||  a new ten - year contract for local and express trains , whereas , previously , the contract was always for one year .
the railways have praised the system , despite the fact that the great majority of fares have not been  |||  increased  |||  .
the only changes are to čd net one - day network tickets and eliška  |||  cheap  |||  internet tickets .
travellers without a customer card will find that the čd net  |||  price  |||  has increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns .
the eliška price will now depend on the distance travelled , whereas , previously , it was a flat rate of 160 crowns to  |||  travel  |||  between any regional cities .
today , gunmen in the south of the philippines kidnapped 75 people , including several primary  |||  school  |||  students and their teachers .
all 17 of the captured children , together with their teacher , were  |||  released  |||  after eight hours .
the kidnapping  |||  happened  |||  in the province of agusan del sur .
around 19 gunmen are apparently  |||  using  |||  the hostages as a human shield in their escape from the police .
|||  local  |||  negotiators are now trying to arrange the release of the remaining hostages .
according to afp , the gunmen are part of the new people 's army ( npa ) , which is the armed faction of the  |||  communist  |||  party of the philippines ( cpp ) .
according to ap , the police had originally been chasing the kidnappers following violence that occurred as accounts were settled between two local  |||  family  |||  clans .
in the province of maguindanao , in the south of the philippines , martial law has been  |||  declared  |||  due to the recent massacre which left 57 people dead .
the governor of this southern filipino province has been  |||  arrested  |||  on suspicion of involvement in the massacre , together with his father andal ampatuan , the patriarch of the influential ampatuan family .
|||  muslim  |||  separatists are also active on mindanao .
in the next few days , the new hollywood film invictus by clint eastwood will hit  |||  american  |||  cinemas , depicting part of the life of the former south african president nelson mandela .
with the film in cinemas critics and the  |||  public  |||
|||  nelson  |||  mandela
nelson rolihlahla mandela was  |||  born  |||  on july 18th , 1918 in mvez , in south africa .
in 1988 he was awarded the sakharov prize for freedom of  |||  thought  |||  , and in 1993 received the nobel peace prize with de klerk .
he was president of  |||  south africa  |||  from 1994 to 1999 .
there were great expectations , as he appeared in public at a time when not only was south africa busy preparing for the football world championship , but the media was also rife with worrying news about  |||  increasing  |||  racial hatred and discrimination by the black majority .
according to the ap news agency , the response to the new film has so far been generally positive in south africa , despite the  |||  number  |||  of objections to " brat - pack " hollywood stars being cast in the main roles .
however , despite what he says , morgan freeman is  |||  proud  |||  of the new film .
i had dreamt about this role for many years and  |||  prepared  |||  for it well .
i met nelson mandela many times to , as they say , draw on his  |||  energy  |||  , he said in an interview after the film 's grand premiere in los angeles .
it is a story about  |||  south africa  |||  , but it affects everybody , he added .
in the  |||  national  |||  rugby team uniform
the film ,  |||  based  |||  on the book by the british writer john carlin , entitled playing the enemy : nelson mandela and the game that made a nation , portrays the south african human rights activist during his first presidential election campaign .
in the film , morgan freeman tries to unite the two races and the populations that had so  |||  long  |||  been segregated and , like nelson mandela did in 1995 , appears in the film in the south african national rugby uniform at the world cup match , which was won by south africa .
white south africans , however , are sceptical , as rugby fan christopher dawson , who fled the country to go to britain , admitted in a  |||  recent  |||  interview for ln .
the championship begins on  |||  june  |||  11th , 2010 .
in the morning , a  |||  fire  |||  broke out in a transformer owned by čeps at the switching station in the village of výškov , near louny .
six  |||  fire  |||  engines came out to fight the fire , said the spokesman for the ústí regional firefighters , lukáš marvan .
the fire was caused by a  |||  technical  |||  fault , a short circuit inside the transformer .
nobody was hurt , and according to company spokesperson pavla mandátová , the incident will not hinder the  |||  safe  |||  operation of the distribution station .
mandátová  |||  says  |||  that the ruined transformer will have to be replaced with a new one .
she added that nothing like this had ever happened in the ten years that čeps has been  |||  operating  |||  , and this kind of fault was a one - off .
in the czech republic , the joint stock company čeps is the exclusive operator of transmission systems and 400 kv and 220 kv  |||  power  |||  lines .
it maintains , restores and develops 39 switching stations with 67 transformers converting  |||  electricity  |||  from the transmission system to the distribution system , as well as 4339 kilometres of power lines .
the owner of student agency , radim jančura , will today file a slander suit against three social  |||  democrat  |||  commissioners .
jančura announced this in the twenty  |||  minutes  |||  programme on radiožurnál .
the suit relates to the company 's attempts to operate regional trains in  |||  certain  |||  regions .
however , all the regions eventually  |||  signed  |||  a long - term contract with czech railways .
they claim that we 're more expensive than czech railways , which is not true , as we know the czech railways prices that were  |||  concluded  |||  last week .
it 's for slander against student agency , jančura  |||  told  |||  radiožurnál .
he also said that he has  |||  proof  |||  from all the regional authorities that they did not act in accordance with european law .
he is therefore preparing a motion for the european  |||  commission  |||  .
hašek sees the suit as a further continuation of mr jančura 's great media  |||  show  |||  , which works as a free advertisement for himself and his company .
it 's understandable that i 'm  |||  prepared  |||  to defend my good name and that of my region , and i call upon the other commissioners to do the same .
i expect that this matter will clearly show that it is mr jančura who is manipulating the public over regional rail transport and  |||  using  |||  lies and false arguments , said hašek .
|||  last  |||  week , jančura said that he is investing several million crowns in advertising to draw attention to these inappropriate actions taken by the regional authorities .
he told radiožurnál that he was halting the campaign for  |||  christmas  |||  and would restart it in the new year .
he specified that the campaign would  |||  fight  |||  corruption as such .
jančura  |||  started  |||  the campaign after the regions decided to operate regional rail links with czech railways and had not announced tenders for the order , worth around 150 billion crowns .
according to jančura this is  |||  illegal  |||  and in contravention of the principles of the european court of justice .
the only threat was that if we do n't stop this , we could  |||  lose  |||  our bus licence .
he  |||  introduced  |||  himself as a member of the čssd , i know who it was but i 'm not going to say his name , jančura told radiožurnál today .
vaccinations against pneumococcus will be  |||  free  |||  and voluntary .
these should be the first  |||  free  |||  yet voluntary vaccinations for families .
preparations for the introduction of  |||  free  |||  anti - pneumococcus vaccinations are reaching a peak .
the pharmaceutical institute is already setting the maximum  |||  price  |||  for vaccines to be paid for by health insurance companies .
experts are now  |||  clear  |||  on how to proceed with the vaccinations .
|||  vaccines  |||  free of charge for children born in august
starting january , there could be  |||  free  |||  anti - pneumococcus vaccinations for children born on or after august 2nd .
anyone who began to be vaccinated last year or  |||  earlier  |||  will have to pay for any later re - vaccinations .
the first batch of vaccinations must be given when the  |||  child  |||  is between 3 and 5 months old .
|||  last  |||  year , one in four families had their children voluntarily vaccinated against pneumococcus .
parents  |||  paid  |||  1600 crowns or more per vaccination .
but they  |||  save  |||  on the treatment that unvaccinated children would otherwise need .
subsidised vaccinations were  |||  introduced  |||  as part of the janota package .
pneumococcus causes infections of the middle ear , but also  |||  serious  |||  infections of the cerebral membranes and blood poisoning .
pneumococcal infections claim the lives of up to 28 children under the age of ten every  |||  year  |||  , according to hospital figures .
will vaccinations be  |||  compulsory  |||  ?
as of january , they should be paid for by the  |||  insurance companies  |||  and not compulsory .
the  |||  head  |||  of the nahlas civil association , rudolf kalovský , says that compulsory vaccinations would be better .
his association has long been  |||  promoting  |||  pneumococcus vaccines .
the specialists at the international conference that our association attended were not very  |||  happy  |||  to hear that we have voluntary vaccinations .
it 's not completely  |||  ideal  |||  .
on the other hand , we 're  |||  happy  |||  that we managed to get at least these voluntary vaccinations in place .
the ministry of health , however , does not want to change the pneumococcus  |||  vaccination  |||  system .
we 're not considering it at this time , said ministry  |||  spokesman  |||  vlastimil sršeň .
|||  voluntary  |||  vaccinations have their drawbacks , say doctors
the chairwoman of the professional society of paediatricians , hana cabrnochová , acknowledges that  |||  voluntary  |||  vaccinations have their drawbacks .
if all children were vaccinated , the number of revaccinations could then be cut . " with vaccines costing so much , we can  |||  understand  |||  the political decision that vaccinations should be offered on a voluntary basis , " says cabrnochová .
the anti - pneumococcus vaccinations are a milestone in that they are the first general vaccinations for children to be  |||  paid  |||  for by the insurance companies , not the state .
insurance companies should fund prevention to  |||  save  |||  money on later treatment , explains cabrnochová .
doctors will have to buy vaccines  |||  themselves  |||
however , practising paediatricians are concerned when it comes to  |||  buying  |||  the vaccines .
according to the original plan , the vaccines would be purchased by the insurance companies , and doctors would  |||  receive  |||  them in the same way that the state issues drugs for other vaccinations .
it is estimated that practising paediatricians will have to  |||  spend  |||  40 thousand a month on vaccines , which is a lot of money .
it certainly wo n't be  |||  easy  |||  , says cabrnochová .
the son of renowned american fantasy artist frank frazetta , has been charged with  |||  trying  |||  to steal paintings worth $ 20m ( gbp 12m ) from his father 's museum .
police in pennsylvania say alfonso  |||  frank  |||  frazetta was caught loading 90 paintings into his vehicle and trailer .
the artist was in florida at the time of the incident , the  |||  associated  |||  press news agency reported .
ap quoted an unnamed police official as saying the younger mr frazetta may have been motivated by a  |||  family  |||  feud .
mr frazetta snr  |||  denied  |||  granting any such permission , the agency said .
labour defends budget tax  |||  rises  |||
ministers have defended the tax rises and spending cuts announced in the pre - budget report against criticism from the opposition ,  |||  business  |||  and unions .
the tories said alistair darling " blew " an opportunity to show he was  |||  serious  |||  about cutting the deficit by delaying decisions until after the election .
among his headline proposals are a 0.5 %  |||  rise  |||  in national insurance and a 1 % cap on public pay settlements from 2011 .
unions have protested that low - paid  |||  workers  |||  are being penalised for a recession not of their making and warned of " problems " ahead .
the national insurance increase - which will raise about gbp 3bn a year - has angered the business community , which says it is a tax on jobs when the  |||  focus  |||  should be on economic recovery .
the  |||  increase  |||  , limited to those earning more than gbp 20,000 a year , will hit about 10 million workers .
key  |||  points  |||  of pbr
national insurance up by a  |||  further  |||  0.5 % from april 2011
economy to shrink by worse than  |||  expected  |||  4.75 % this year
new 50 % tax on banker  |||  bonuses  |||
1p rise in corporation tax for  |||  small  |||  firms scrapped
state pension to  |||  rise  |||  by 2.5 %
according to treasury estimates , someone earning gbp 30,000 will be gbp 90 a  |||  year  |||  worse off and someone on gbp 40,000 will be gbp 190 worse off , while someone earning gbp 10,000 a year will be gbp 110 better off .
treasury minister stephen timms denied the tax rises and spending cuts outlined were a " drop in the ocean " compared to what was  |||  needed  |||  .
" these are large numbers . they will deliver for us this halving of the deficit which is absolutely  |||  essential  |||  over the next four years , " he told the bbc .
mr timms said he was confident the economy would return to growth by the  |||  turn  |||  of the year .
however , labour forecasts for future economic growth - which will influence the amount it has to borrow and how quickly he deficit is cut - have been questioned after the chancellor was  |||  forced  |||  to revise earlier figures .
' blown  |||  opportunity  |||  '
the conservatives , who will launch a new advertising campaign on thursday warning of labour 's " debt crisis " , said projected borrowing of gbp 789bn over the  |||  next  |||  six years was unsustainable .
" they have not included anything of significance they are going to do , " said  |||  shadow  |||  treasury minister philip hammond . " they had an opportunity to do it and they have blown it . "
" the all important announcements will come after the  |||  election  |||  , whoever wins it "
but the lib dems said the money raised by tax rises and spending cuts would be used to support spending next year not to reduce the deficit , arguing the plans were "  |||  built  |||  on sand " .
the bbc 's political editor nick robinson said some of the timing of the announcements - such as the above inflation  |||  increase  |||  in some disability benefits next april - would leave the chancellor open to accusations of electioneering as the money may simply be clawed back the year after .
however , labour insist the extra help is being  |||  provided  |||  when people need it most and the situation will be reviewed in september 2010 .
' phoney  |||  budget  |||  '
the respected institute for fiscal studies said the chancellor 's figures implied  |||  substantial  |||  cuts in many areas , potentially including transport , higher education , science and defence , in the future .
" it really is holding off the pain until later , " said its  |||  director  |||  robert chote .
" the all important announcements will come after the election , whoever wins it , " added roger bootle ,  |||  economic  |||  adviser to accountants deloitte .
the fbi has said it is investigating whether they are the same men who were reported missing from their homes in the us state of virginia  |||  last  |||  month .
three of them are  |||  reported  |||  to be of pakistani descent , one of egyptian heritage and the other of a yemeni background .
" we are  |||  working  |||  with pakistan authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there , if indeed these are the students who had gone missing , " she said .
the pakistani embassy in washington said the men were  |||  arrested  |||  in a house belonging to an uncle of one of them .
he said the house was already of  |||  interest  |||  to local police and that no charges had yet been filed against the arrested men .
secretary of state hillary clinton declined to comment on the arrests , reported the reuters news agency , but said the us had to " work more closely with both afghanistan and pakistan to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and  |||  train  |||  people " .
the five students were reported missing from their homes in northern virginia by their families in  |||  late  |||  november .
human rights in iran are as  |||  poor  |||  as at any time over the past 20 years , according to a report from campaign group amnesty international .
the report details " patterns of abuse " by the regime  |||  before  |||  and after disputed presidential elections in june .
one man quoted in the report said he had been beaten and burned with cigarettes . another said he was  |||  threatened  |||  with rape .
|||  officials  |||  have said such criticism is politically motivated .
thousands of people were arrested and dozens  |||  killed  |||  in iran after the disputed election of president mahmoud ahmadinejad led to the largest street protests since the 1979 islamic revolution .
bbc tehran correspondent , jon leyne , who is now in london , says that  |||  early  |||  in the protests , the supreme leader , ayatollah ali khamenei , accepted some of the allegations of abuse , ordering the closure of the kahrizak detention centre .
'  |||  false  |||  confession '
amnesty international cited the account of 26 - year - old computing student ebrahim mehtari , who said he was accused of "  |||  working  |||  with facebook networks " and protesting against the election result .
" they frequently beat me on the  |||  face  |||  , " he was quoted as saying .
" i was burned with cigarettes under my eyes , on the neck ,  |||  head  |||  ... they threatened to execute me and they humiliated me . "
after five days he signed a false confession and was taken out and  |||  left  |||  in the street , still bleeding and semi - conscious , amnesty said .
in august , defeated presidential candidate mehdi karroubi said some protesters detained after the election had been tortured to death in prison and  |||  others  |||  had been raped .
amnesty also cited the case of a former detainee who said he was  |||  held  |||  in a container with 75 others for more than eight weeks at a detention centre at kahrizak .
amnesty accepted that the iranian parliament and judiciary had  |||  established  |||  committees to investigate the post - election unrest and the government 's response , but it said the mandate and powers of the bodies were unclear and the parliamentary committee 's findings had not been made public .
more than 100 tonnes of  |||  artificial  |||  snow were used to turn a bristol landmark into a piste for a competition .
the piste in the park event attracted 16 semi - professional skiers and snow borders competing for  |||  cash  |||  prizes .
at the top of the slope in brandon hill park there was a  |||  short  |||  jump ramp before a 100m - long slope .
fourth - year medical student john hickman said there was a beautiful  |||  view  |||  from the top of the slope but it was pretty daunting .
it 's a beautiful  |||  view  |||  with all the city lights below all twinkling .
there 's some of the best skiers and snow borders in the county here - some  |||  real  |||  talent , " he added .
after thursday evening 's event the  |||  snow  |||  will be left to melt away .
pluralism and pragmatism in a secularist  |||  state  |||  .
some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author 's last work , " why the french do n't like headscarves " ( 2006 ) , an elegant and closely argued study of an  |||  issue  |||  that divided and preoccupied the country for a decade and a half , and whose effects are still felt today .
mr bowen 's  |||  latest  |||  book has a broader and more ambitious canvas .
he has  |||  spent  |||  months in the mosques , schools and institutes which now provide france 's 5m - 6m muslims with what mr bowen calls " islamic spaces " .
he is a good listener , reproducing debates between teachers and students about the questions that  |||  concern  |||  them most .
should a  |||  muslim  |||  get married in a mosque or a town hall ( or both ) ?
should  |||  young  |||  muslims be taught about evolution and gay rights ?
it is these seemingly mundane  |||  issues  |||  , he argues , that are the stuff of daily life rather than the political dramas that preoccupy the media .
this new generation is  |||  trying  |||  to open up the debate about how to be both a good muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society .
they are not having the  |||  argument  |||  all their way .
conservatives are suspicious of the very idea of a  |||  french  |||  or european islam .
mr bowen thinks that muslim values and  |||  french  |||  secularism could be compatible .
he questions how far  |||  french  |||  policymakers ( and the intellectual elite that so fiercely guards laïcité ) are really committed to pluralism .
the bleakest outlook in the  |||  world  |||
the arctic is  |||  changing  |||  faster and more dramatically than any other environment on the planet .
the ice that defines it is melting with alarming speed , taking with it life that can survive nowhere  |||  else  |||  .
in " on thin ice " richard ellis , a writer and illustrator , paints a  |||  natural  |||  history of the icon of the north , the polar bear .
admiral nelson 's encounter as a plucky 14 - year - old midshipman  |||  fighting  |||  only with the butt of his musket is surely a myth , but others are true .
young bears , captured as they swam after the bodies of their newly  |||  killed  |||  mothers , were caught and sent to zoos and circuses .
mr ellis draws on the accounts of other writers and historians , and often returns to the  |||  threat  |||  that hunters pose to the survival of the species .
in his new book , " after the ice " , alun anderson , a former editor of new scientist , offers a clear and chilling account of the science of the arctic and a gripping glimpse of how the future may  |||  turn  |||  out there .
not that  |||  scientists  |||  have all the answers .
neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately account for the  |||  speed  |||  of the changes .
fridtjof nansen 's pioneering journeys at the end of the 19th century and  |||  early  |||  20th century first hinted at the whirling of the ice pack .

marines among 6,000 who place wreaths on  |||  graves  |||  at arlington
pfc . de'angello robinson , 19 , traveled seven  |||  hours  |||  by bus to place a single wreath on the tomb of a soldier whom he 'd never met .
for him , and the other marines who took the trip from camp johnson in jacksonville , n.c. to arlington  |||  national  |||  cemetery to decorate graves , the day was about paying tribute to men and women who once stood in their shoes .
if it is us , i would want somebody to do the same for me so i 'm just trying to show  |||  respect  |||  .
in 1992 , morrill worcester , owner of worcester wreath company in harrington , maine , began the event when he and several  |||  others  |||  decided to decorate several hundred gravesites at arlington ceremony .
now an 18 - year - old tradition , morrill and his wife karen , make the trip every year stopping in  |||  different  |||  cities along the way to host events dedicated to the people in the military and victims of terrorism .
the worcesters also founded a non - profit , wreaths  |||  across  |||  america , which has spread the event across other states .
this year , volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at arlington cemetery , areas at the pentagon , graves at fayetteville  |||  national  |||  cemetery in arkansas , battery park in new york city and on the memorial site for united airlines flight 93 in shanksville , pa.
for the second year , the walmart foundation donated more than $ 150,000 to  |||  purchase  |||  , and transport the wreaths .
charleen hunt , 70 , of westminster , said she made the trip to arlington in honor of her husband , a deceased career  |||  military  |||  man .
it 's a small way civilians can  |||  support  |||  our troops , she said .
it 's like visiting a  |||  family  |||  gravesite .
wrapped in layers of  |||  warm  |||  clothing , volunteers walked across the cemetery 's expansive lawns and hills .
volunteers targeted older tombs from world war i ,  |||  world  |||  war ii , and the war in vietnam because they are not visited as often as newer graves , organizers said .
the mood was upbeat as children played and couples  |||  held  |||  hands while carrying the fresh pine to the graying tombstones .
|||  each  |||  circular wreath was a deep green with a small red bow fastened across the top .
nearby , section 60 , where most veterans of the wars in iraq and afghanistan are buried ,  |||  remained  |||  virtually silent .
some  |||  read  |||  aloud names carved into the stones while others bowed to see small black and white place cards pushed inside wet mud for those whose tombstones have not yet been completed .
sandra lockwood was one of the many mothers wiping tears from her  |||  eyes  |||  in front of her son 's grave .
she drove eight hours from zanesfield , ohio to visit the gravesite of marine gunnery sgt. david shane spicer who died in  |||  combat  |||  in july .
nobody should ever forget why we 're free . . . my son  |||  paid  |||  for that , she said .
the contractor , who has not yet been  |||  identified  |||  , works for development alternatives inc. , based in bethesda .
the company  |||  works  |||  on projects for clients such as the u.s. agency for international development and the world bank .
the  |||  specific  |||  charges have not been made public , though under cuban law , a cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for nearly anything under the claim of " dangerousness . "
all so - called counter - revolutionary activities , which include mild protests and  |||  critical  |||  writings , carry the risk of arrest .
anti - government graffiti and speech are  |||  considered  |||  serious crimes .
cuba has a fledging blogging community , led by the  |||  popular  |||  commentator yoani sánchez , who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents .
sánchez has repeatedly applied for permission to  |||  leave  |||  the country to accept awards but has been denied permission .
the detention of an  |||  american  |||  contractor may likely raise tensions between the castro brothers communist government in cuba and the obama administration , which has been pursuing a " go - slow " approach to improving relations with the island .
the new u.s. policy stresses that if the cuban government takes concrete steps , such as freeing political prisoners and  |||  creating  |||  more space for opposition , the united states will reciprocate .
cellphones and laptops are legal in cuba ,  |||  though  |||  they are new and coveted commodities in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $ 15 a month .
the cuban government  |||  granted  |||  ordinary citizens the right to buy cellphones just this year ; they are used mostly for texting , as a 15 - minute telephone conversation would eat up a day 's wages .
internet use is extremely  |||  limited  |||  on the island .
it is available in  |||  expensive  |||  hotels and to foreign visitors there , and at some government outlets , such as universities .
cubans who want to log on often have to give their  |||  names  |||  to the government .
the detention of an  |||  american  |||  in cuba is rare .
most of the handful of u.s. citizens in jail in cuba are behind bars for crimes such as  |||  drug  |||  smuggling , said gloria berbena , the press officer at the u.s. interests section in havana .
berbena said she could not  |||  provide  |||  more information on the arrest .
vivanco said that the accused are often arrested ,  |||  tried  |||  and imprisoned in a day .
he said that any solution would likely be  |||  political  |||  and that the cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the united states just as the two countries begin to move toward more dialogue .
pakistani authorities on saturday zeroed in on the alleged mastermind of a plot to  |||  send  |||  five northern virginia men to afghanistan to kill u.s. troops , saying they hope the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters who scour the internet for radicalized young men .
investigators said they were hunting for a shadowy insurgent figure  |||  known  |||  as saifullah , who invited the men to pakistan after first discovering them when one made comments approving of terror attacks on the internet video site youtube .
saifullah guided the men once they were in pakistan , attempting to help them reach the remote area in pakistan 's tribal belt that is  |||  home  |||  to al-qaeda and its terrorist training camps .
but a pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said saturday that saifullah was unsuccessful in convincing al-qaeda commanders that the men were not  |||  part  |||  of a cia plot to infiltrate the terrorist network .
as a result , they were marooned for days in the eastern city of sargodha , far from the forbidding mountains of the northwest that have become a  |||  terrorist  |||  haven .
that 's why they were rejected , said the  |||  official  |||  , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case .
the official said the men were undeterred and were still trying to acquire the right endorsements to gain access to the al-qaeda camps when they were  |||  arrested  |||  by pakistani law enforcement .
the case of the five -- who remain in pakistan and are being questioned by the fbi -- underscores the  |||  critical  |||  role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and , perhaps more importantly , determining who can be trusted .
the organization 's recruiters act as gatekeepers , keeping out those who are not  |||  serious  |||  about their commitment to holy war , and those who could be spies .
would - be  |||  american  |||  recruits are treated by al-qaeda with special scrutiny , analysts said .
but they are also  |||  considered  |||  enormously appealing to the group because of their potential to access u.s. targets and because of their propaganda value .
but evan kohlmann , senior analyst with the u.s. -  |||  based  |||  nefa foundation , said terror groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they allow in because u.s. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruiting methods .
the  |||  model  |||  is one that has become far more web - based .
tens of thousands protest in copenhagen , demand climate '  |||  action  |||  '
tens of thousands of protesters marched on the streets here saturday ,  |||  demanding  |||  bolder action on climate from the negotiators working inside the city 's bella convention center .
the event was relatively  |||  peaceful  |||  , though a handful of masked activists set off small explosives near a group of government buildings downtown .
this is part of the reason why i have decided to join the big march -- to pass on the word and to appeal to the world 's leaders to deliver a fair , ambitious and binding  |||  deal  |||  , she said .
it is not an easy  |||  task  |||  , but it needs to be done , there is no way around it anymore .
those activities are  |||  banned  |||  during demonstrations under danish law .
according to one bystander , who asked not to be  |||  identified  |||  because he is involved in the climate talks , activists sporting masks and black outfits set off several explosives near copenhagen 's main canal , which is nearby several ministries .
inside the convention center , people gathered  |||  around  |||  television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon .
but the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key  |||  officials  |||  such as su wei , china 's chief climate negotiator .
he then continued in mandarin ,  |||  saying  |||  , " because the venue is large , i cannot hear what is happening outside . "
it shows the concentration of the  |||  general  |||  public and different sectors on the subject of climate change , he said .
|||  test  |||  data reveal stubborn racial gaps
last week 's federal report card on math achievement was a welcome piece of good  |||  news  |||  for d.c. public schools .
but what remains embedded in the latest numbers from the  |||  national  |||  assessment of educational progress is the persistent achievement gap between african american and white students both locally and nationally .
the  |||  average  |||  scores of white d.c. fourth - graders over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 ( on a scale of 500 ) , but their african american peers ' rose just three points , from 209 to 212 .
the achievement gap actually grew between 2007 and 2009 , from 53 to 58  |||  points  |||  .
african american progress in the eighth grade remained essentially flat , dipping a statistically insignificant one  |||  point  |||  , from 245 to 244 .
average white scores were not included in the test results because the sample size was n't  |||  large  |||  enough .
the gap separating white and  |||  black  |||  fourth - graders in 2003 , when the first naep in the district was given , was 60 scale points ( 262 to 202 ) .
some education advocates in the district expressed concern  |||  last  |||  week that the gains celebrated by chancellor michelle a. rhee and mayor adrian m. fenty ( d ) were propelled largely by white students who are already high achievers .
i 'm not jumping up and down about a two - or three -  |||  point  |||  spread , said d.c. council member kwame r. brown ( d - at large ) , who has a daughter in the fourth grade at eaton elementary .
a frequent critic of rhee 's management style , brown said the message of the  |||  test  |||  scores is that the city 's middle schools are in desperate need of attention .
clearly , you always want to see the plus signs , and i  |||  respect  |||  that .
but what 's scary is we 're not spending nearly the time and  |||  energy  |||  we need to spend on our middle schools .
this  |||  fall  |||  , for example , some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum , the wilson reading system , targeted to students in the upper elementary and middle school grades who did n't master the basics of reading early in their school careers and are significantly behind their peers .
i just think we have to keep  |||  working  |||  at bringing the best interventions to those students who are below grade level , rhee said .
others say that the naep 's results highlight the question of whether rhee can continue to lift the overall performance of the system and still  |||  provide  |||  the additional money and resources for low - performing schools that will be necessary to narrow the gap .
there is a sort of rough - edged dilemma here for michelle rhee , said bruce fuller , an education professor at the university of california at berkeley who studies urban  |||  test  |||  scores .
the conventional policy remedy is to target your resources and management reforms on schools  |||  located  |||  in the poorest sections of d.c.
so the targeting may yield political repercussions that go against that important  |||  agenda  |||  .
but the rub , of course , is like other urban superintendents , she 's trying to  |||  hold  |||  on to the white and black middle class .
our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of great  |||  schools  |||  .
we need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families , regardless of where they live , are confident that their children can get an excellent  |||  public  |||  education .
janey , now superintendent of schools in newark , said in an interview this week that one  |||  essential  |||  element to closing the achievement gap is to lengthen the traditional public school year , currently 180 days in the district , to compete with charter schools .
you have to get up near 200 days to have the force of change , said janey , who came to agreement with his teachers ' union last year on a 185 - day year , which he regards as " a marker " for seeking a bigger  |||  increase  |||  in the next contract .
making higher education a part of more  |||  futures  |||
graciela rodriguez , 12 , stepped off and blinked for a moment at the  |||  white  |||  columns , brick facades and emerald lawns .
graciela 's parents had barely graduated from high  |||  school  |||  in el salvador .
yet as she and the other eighth - graders in the group explored gettysburg , where the tuition runs $ 38,690 a year , their attitude was less that of awestruck  |||  visitors  |||  than of enthusiastic prospective students .
yes ! this is where i 'll be ! exclaimed graciela , who would like to study medicine , when the guide announced that they 'd entered the science  |||  building  |||  .
although there is mounting concern about the large number u.s. -  |||  born  |||  children of hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or get pregnant as teenagers , there are also hundreds of thousands who are getting the college educations they need to enter the middle class .
in fact , one in five of these " second - generation " hispanics graduates from college -- a notable achievement given that so many of their immigrant parents , mostly mexicans and central americans , entered the united states without finishing high  |||  school  |||  .
their success stories are important ,  |||  researchers  |||  say , because they point the way forward for a generation that will play an outsize role in the country 's workforce .
those who study high achievers say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate drive to  |||  succeed  |||  .
many also have parents who set lofty goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their unfamiliarity with  |||  american  |||  schools .
when you 're looking at low - income kids whose parents do n't have the experience and the skills to help them navigate through the system , any single intervention at any one  |||  point  |||  in time is not going to solve it , said patricia gándara , a researcher at the university of california , davis , who has studied latino students .
we need to think about  |||  providing  |||  a supportive network for these kids from preschool all the way on through high school .
the federal program that  |||  funded  |||  graciela 's college tour is a useful example .
|||  known  |||  as gear up , it provides more than $ 300 million a year to local school systems to run college prep programs that begin when low - income students are in middle school and continue until they finish high school .
|||  iraqi  |||  oil ministry reaches deals with 10 foreign oil companies
despite concerns about violence and political instability , the iraqi government managed to attract  |||  major  |||  oil companies to rebuild its ailing infrastructure during two auctions that concluded saturday .
the 10 deals the iraqi oil ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that china , russia and european oil firms are poised to play a  |||  major  |||  role in refurbishing iraq 's oil industry , crippled by decades of war and sanctions .
|||  american  |||  companies walked away with stakes in just two of the 10 auctioned fields .
seven  |||  american  |||  companies had paid to participate in the second auction , which began friday .
the only one that submitted a bid  |||  lost  |||  .
two  |||  american  |||  companies reached deals for fields auctioned in june .
the meager representation of  |||  american  |||  oil giants in iraq 's opening oil industry surprised analysts .
iraq finally  |||  opened  |||  its doors after six years of war , and instead of u.s. companies , you have asians and europeans leading the way , said ruba husari , the editor of iraq oil forum , an online news outlet .
it will be a long time before  |||  anything  |||  else will be on offer in iraq .
concerns over security , underscored by massive  |||  coordinated  |||  bombings tuesday , and political instability as the u.s. military withdraws , likely kept american oil companies from venturing more forcefully in iraq , which has the world 's third - largest proven crude reserves , analysts said .
u.s. firms were in some cases at a disadvantage because rivals , particularly the chinese and other government  |||  controlled  |||  energy firms , have markedly lower labor costs and are more prone to take risks because they do n't respond to shareholders .
exxon - mobil and occidental petroleum inc. were the only  |||  american  |||  companies that reached deals with the ministry .
state - owned chinese national petroleum corp. bid on more contracts than any other company and walked away with large stakes in contracts for two  |||  major  |||  fields .
we all know that china is on track to become a  |||  major  |||  economic as well as technological power , oil ministry spokesman assam jihad said .
we feel confident that the  |||  chinese  |||  company will be on par with its competitors and will deliver on its commitments towards iraq .
companies pre - selected to submit bids made offers that were then compared to the per barrel fee the ministry was willing to pay for boosting output above  |||  current  |||  levels at each field .
top al-qaeda planner apparently  |||  killed  |||  in pakistan
saleh al-somali was one of two arab men thought to have been  |||  killed  |||  when a pair of missiles tore into their car tuesday near the town of miran shah in north waziristan province , according to u.s. sources and pakistani officials in the region .
local authorities said the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the  |||  type  |||  operated by the cia inside pakistan 's lawless tribal belt .
they were driving in a white car , heading toward the afghan  |||  border  |||  , when the car was hit , said an official with pakistan 's civilian intelligence agency , speaking by phone from miran shah .
local authorities were unable to verify the victims ' identities , but two u.s. counterterrorism  |||  officials  |||  cited unspecified evidence that somali was among the dead .
he was engaged in plotting throughout the world , said one senior official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity , citing the sensitive  |||  nature  |||  of u.s. airstrikes inside pakistani territory .
he took strategic guidance from al-qaeda 's top leadership and translated it into operational blueprints for prospective  |||  terrorist  |||  attacks .
he may not be a household name to some americans , but that in no way diminishes the threat he posed to us and our allies , the  |||  second  |||  official said .
if his death is confirmed , somali would be the second senior al-qaeda or taliban leader  |||  killed  |||  since september , when a similar strike killed najmuddin jalolov , the leader of a militant faction in the tribal belt , and three other top operatives .
the tempo of strikes by cia - run drones has declined since the summer , from an average of about six operations per month to two , according to a tally by the long war journal , a web site  |||  managed  |||  by a nonprofit group .
the decline may be due to  |||  improved  |||  tactics by terrorist groups , which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants , the site said .
top u.n. envoy in  |||  kabul  |||  to step down
the united nations ' top envoy in afghanistan , kai eide , said friday that he would step down from his post in march , ending a tumultuous tenure that was marred by allegations of  |||  widespread  |||  corruption in afghanistan 's u.n. - backed presidential election .
eide 's departure comes as the obama  |||  administration  |||  has decided to send an additional 30,000 u.s. troops to afghanistan .
the u.n. envoy said that he supports the surge but expressed  |||  concern  |||  that the u.s. timetable for a military drawdown beginning in 18 months would prompt other nato governments to withdraw their forces .
we need to accelerate the buildup of the afghan security forces and  |||  send  |||  the right signal to the afghans that they can trust the international community , eide said in a telephone interview from kabul .
the norwegian diplomat also pressed the united states and other military powers to  |||  increase  |||  the number of international civil servants aiding afghanistan 's political transition .
the surge on the  |||  military  |||  side has to be copied on the civilian side , he said .
eide said he was not resigning but simply fulfilling a commitment he made to his family in march 2008 to  |||  spend  |||  only two years in kabul .
secretary  |||  general  |||  ban ki - moon now so that he would have time to find a replacement .
when i  |||  came  |||  here , there was a two - month vacuum between a departure of my predecessor and my arrival .
ban has begun searching for a replacement , according to u.n.  |||  officials  |||  .
eide 's standing in afghanistan was tested after his former deputy , peter w. galbraith , accused him in september of favoring president hamid karzai in the country 's presidential vote and of covering up evidence of  |||  massive  |||  electoral fraud .
eide denied the allegations , but he said the accusations by galbraith -- who was fired -- " certainly  |||  damaged  |||  the mission , because there was already a great degree of skepticism with regard to international interference " in the election .
eide expressed frustration with the limitations on his powers in afghanistan ,  |||  saying  |||  that cumbersome u.n. hiring regulations undercut his ability to bring in talent .
the u.n. rules are such that i have only been able to recruit a  |||  single  |||  person since may , he said .
that is catastrophic and ca n't  |||  continue  |||  .
gates : iran to  |||  face  |||  additional sanctions
defense secretary robert m. gates said friday that world powers will soon impose "  |||  significant  |||  additional sanctions " on iran over its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions .
gates ,  |||  speaking  |||  to a group of about 300 u.s. troops in northern iraq during a week - long tour of war zones in afghanistan and iraq , played down the prospect of military action against the islamic republic .
there are no good options in iran , he said , in response to a query from a soldier about the likelihood of such a  |||  development  |||  . ̈
the obama administration is considering a package of sanctions that would target iran 's military and political elite , but gates signaled that some of the sanctions could also  |||  affect  |||  ordinary iranians .
he said that " a package of incentives and disincentives " would be needed " to persuade the iranian government that they would actually be less  |||  secure  |||  with nuclear weapons " because " their people will suffer enormously " from sanctions .
in a statement friday by white house spokesman robert gibbs , the administration joined european  |||  leaders  |||  in warning that iran will face " credible " consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the u.n. security council and its nuclear watchdog , the international atomic energy agency .
iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear expertise only for  |||  peaceful  |||  purposes .
in talks in geneva on oct. 1 , it indicated that it would return to talks on restraining its nuclear program and agree to give up a  |||  substantial  |||  portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor .
the  |||  administration  |||  has pushed for such an agreement as a way to build confidence between the two sides and to buy time for negotiations .
but since then , iran appears to have walked away from the tentative deals -- in part , experts say , because the iranian leadership is  |||  divided  |||  over whether to engage with the united states .
frankly , iran 's stiffing the international community on some of the proposals that they actually  |||  agreed  |||  to at the beginning of october , i think , has brought the international community , including the russians and the chinese , together in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions on the iranians , gates said .
president obama has set a dec. 31 deadline for iran to  |||  respond  |||  to the proposals before he turns to reviewing other options , including pursuing what secretary of state hillary rodham clinton once called " crippling sanctions . "
gates , who was to  |||  return  |||  to washington late friday , met in the morning with iraqi prime minister nouri al-maliki before flying to iraq 's oil - rich kurdish region for meetings with troops in kirkuk and kurdish officials in irbil .
tensions  |||  remain  |||  high between the kurds and iraq 's arab majority , particularly over boundaries , property rights and revenue - sharing .
gates urged both sides to  |||  reduce  |||  the potential for conflict to prevent any delays in u.s. plans to cut the number of american troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of august .
we will not  |||  abandon  |||  you . "
in aging china , a change of  |||  course  |||
wang weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters lecturing them that "  |||  mother  |||  earth is too tired to sustain more children " and " one more baby means one more tomb . "
they learned the lesson so well that when shanghai government officials , alarmed by their city 's low birthrate and aging population , abruptly changed course this summer and began  |||  encouraging  |||  young couples to have more than one child , their reaction was instant and firm : no way .
we have already given all our time and  |||  energy  |||  for just one child .
more than 30 years after china 's one - child policy was introduced , creating two generations of notoriously chubby , spoiled only children affectionately nicknamed "  |||  little  |||  emperors , " a population crisis is looming in the country .
the  |||  average  |||  birthrate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple as compared with six when the policy went into effect , according to the u.n.
|||  population  |||  division , while the number of residents 60 and older is predicted to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050 . that is far above the global average of about 20 percent .
the imbalance is worse in wealthy coastal cities with highly educated  |||  populations  |||  , such as shanghai .
last year , people 60 and older accounted for almost 22 percent of shanghai 's  |||  registered  |||  residents , while the birthrate was less than one child per couple .
shanghai is about to be " as old -- not as rich , though -- as  |||  developed  |||  countries such as japan and sweden , " she said .
written into the country 's constitution in 1978 , china 's one - child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate  |||  introduced  |||  by the ruling communist party to date .
couples who violate the policy face  |||  enormous  |||  fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work .
chinese officials have credited the policy with helping the country  |||  avoid  |||  critical strain on its natural resources , while human rights advocates have denounced abuses in the enforcement of the policy .
in addition , many couples have had sex - selective abortions ,  |||  leading  |||  to an unnaturally high male - to - female ratio .
in recent years ,  |||  population  |||  officials have gradually softened their stance on the one - child policy .
qiao xiaochun , a professor at the institute of population research at peking university , said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes , such as  |||  allowing  |||  couples to have two children if one partner is an only child .
almost overnight , posters directing families to have only one child were replaced by copies of  |||  regulations  |||  detailing who would be eligible to have a second child and how to apply for a permit .
it has also pledged to provide emotional and financial counseling to those electing to have more than one  |||  child  |||  .
the response has been underwhelming , family planning  |||  officials  |||  say .
disappointing  |||  response  |||
although  |||  officials  |||  in one rural town on the outskirts of shanghai say they saw an uptick in applications from couples wanting a second child after the campaign was launched , the more urban districts report no change .
disappointed shanghai officials say that , despite the campaign , the number of births in the city in 2010 is still  |||  expected  |||  to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008 .
feng juying ,  |||  head  |||  of the family planning committee in shanghai 's caolu township , said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people do n't want more children .
they want to give the  |||  best  |||  to their first , she said .
yang jiawei , 27 , and his  |||  wife  |||  , liu juanjuan , 26 , said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to do so .
but like many chinese , they have only the scant medical and life insurance  |||  provided  |||  by the government .
without a social safety net , they say , the  |||  choice  |||  would be irresponsible .
people in the west wrongly see the one - child policy as a rights issue , said yang , a  |||  construction  |||  engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple 's first child .
yes , we are being robbed of the  |||  chance  |||  to have more than one child .
but the problem is not just some  |||  policy  |||  .
it is  |||  money  |||  .
other couples cite  |||  psychological  |||  reasons for hesitating .
we are not used to taking care of and do n't really want to take care of  |||  others  |||  . "
for the dual - career , middle - class parents who are bringing the birthrate down , he said , it 's about being  |||  successful  |||  enough to be selfish .
today 's 20- and 30 - somethings grew up seeing their parents struggle during the early days of china 's experiment with capitalism and do n't want that  |||  kind  |||  of life for themselves , he said .
a mother has to give up at least two years of her social  |||  life  |||  .
most of his  |||  friends  |||  are willing to deal with this once , chen said , but not twice .
we do not want to make too many  |||  sacrifices  |||  .
u.n. group drafts plan to  |||  reduce  |||  emissions
the u.n. - sponsored climate conference -- characterized so far by unruly posturing and mutual recriminations -- gained  |||  renewed  |||  focus friday with the release of a document outlining ambitious greenhouse - gas reductions over the next 40 years , with industrialized nations shouldering most of the burden in the near term .
the text , which could provide the basis for a final political  |||  deal  |||  to regulate greenhouse gases , highlighted the remaining obstacles as much as it illuminated a path forward .
but it was  |||  seen  |||  as an important advance in a negotiation that is running out of time , with more than 100 world leaders arriving in copenhagen next week .
forged by a u.n. ad - hoc working group , the text is silent on how much money rich countries would give poor ones to cope with global warming over the  |||  short  |||  and long term .
and it provides a range of options for the key questions , including how  |||  developed  |||  and major emerging economies would cut their carbon output , and what would be the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers would be willing to tolerate .
michael zammit cutajar , who drafted the six - page document , boiled down a 180 - page negotiation text to  |||  focus  |||  on what the u.n. 's top climate official , yvo de boer , described as " the big picture . "
it shows the outlines for a possible deal , in which industrial nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent compared with 1990 levels , while  |||  major  |||  developing countries would reduce theirs during the same period by 15 to 30 percent .
|||  together  |||  , the countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050 .
the european union gave the talks a boost as well on friday by pledging to  |||  provide  |||  $ 3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- from coping with flood and drought to avoiding deforestation .
still , friday featured the same  |||  sort  |||  of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks for the past week .
u.s. special climate envoy todd stern rejected language requiring binding cuts of greenhouse - gas emissions for industrialized countries compared with voluntary ones by  |||  major  |||  emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world .
the move signaled that the obama  |||  administration  |||  is taking a harder line with china than bush administration officials did just two years ago .
stern made his comments an hour after  |||  chinese  |||  vice foreign minister he yafei said america 's top climate negotiator was either lacking " common sense " or being " extremely irresponsible " for saying earlier in the week that the united states would not help china financially to cope with global warming .
with the future economic trajectory of the world 's major powers at stake , fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and  |||  emerging  |||  economies .
the current battle is as much about saving individual economies as saving the planet , with china and the united states feuding over their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the world 's two dozen most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take bolder  |||  action  |||  .
ricardo ulate , a costa rican delegate , said it 's not surprising that the  |||  major  |||  powers are fighting over who should bear the costs for curbing greenhouse gases , even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to hold the big emitters accountable for their actions .
this is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being  |||  developed  |||  , said ulate , who also serves as the regional mexico and central america climate change adviser for conservation international .
some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in copenhagen , although most of the  |||  major  |||  participants say the talks will produce a political deal at best .
the alliance of small island states , which has 43  |||  members  |||  , produced a 24 - page draft treaty proposal early friday morning .
artur runge - metzger , who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the european commission , said the push by small island nations has " put political pressure on the entire political process , " in part because they are now unified and  |||  demanding  |||  action from emerging economies such as china and india .
the talks took on new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government arrive to strike a  |||  deal  |||  .
high - level officials such as indian environment minister jairam ramesh and the  |||  chinese  |||  vice minister stepped off planes and raced through the bella center 's halls to closed - door meetings and news conferences so they could stake out claims that will be arbitrated over the next week .
the intensity is only building : nearly all of the key ministers are now here , and as  |||  early  |||  as wednesday 60 heads of government will be in copenhagen .
we 're getting into the big leagues , said carlos manuel rodriguez , vice president for  |||  global  |||  policy at conservation international .
britain 's first 140mph  |||  train  |||  to redefine that monday feeling
at 5.13 on monday morning a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a  |||  train  |||  departure that marks a revolution for travel in britain .
the first high - speed commuter  |||  train  |||  in the country will reach 140mph as it streaks from ashford , kent , to london st pancras , covering the 58 miles in 38 minutes .
lord adonis , the transport secretary , will then be  |||  joined  |||  by dame kelly holmes aboard the first javelin commuter service out of london .
he hopes that the new service will eventually plug britain into an international network of fast ,  |||  reliable  |||  trains and connect the great conurbations of the midlands , the north and scotland to london .
neglected backwaters would become thriving commuter towns ,  |||  business  |||  travel times would be slashed and the shift from aircraft and cars to the railway would reduce national carbon emissions as well as easing congestion on the roads .
in theory , the three main  |||  political  |||  parties buy into this vision .
but the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network , the inevitable planning battle and fears of  |||  environmental  |||  harm may yet put the brakes on britain 's high - speed lines .
high speed two ( hs 2 ) , a company  |||  created  |||  in january to provide the government with a feasibility study , will hand its report to lord adonis on december 30 , the times has learnt .
it will provide him with a detailed route map of the next  |||  planned  |||  stage of the high - speed network .
the new line linking london to the west midlands will be drawn to within five metres in urban areas and sites where the  |||  environmental  |||  impact may be contentious .
in  |||  open  |||  country , the plan will be drafted to within 25 metres of a final route .
lord adonis will  |||  respond  |||  in the spring .
the favoured  |||  option  |||  being put forward is a y - shaped configuration in which a single high - speed line would run up to the west midlands .
the line would split at or near birmingham , with one branch running west of the pennines to manchester and scotland and  |||  another  |||  running northeast to sheffield , leeds and newcastle upon tyne .
a single line would run into  |||  scotland  |||  .
the first leg , which would not open before 2025 , would allow passengers to travel between london and birmingham in 49 minutes , compared with just over an hour at  |||  present  |||  .
the proposals would allow trains to travel at 250mph , making the  |||  british  |||  network the fastest in europe .
as many as 18 could operate  |||  each  |||  hour on a london - birmingham line .
that means that a london terminal capable of handling 20,000 passengers an hour would be  |||  needed  |||  .
given space constraints in the capital , it is expected that an existing station would be  |||  expanded  |||  to accommodate the high - speed network .
rail industry experts say that only st pancras international or euston  |||  offer  |||  that potential .
lord adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the scheme should proceed , but lengthy public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision would not be made until after a  |||  general  |||  election .
even if he does put the wheels in motion , the network would have to be  |||  built  |||  in sections .
trains would at first be forced to run off high - speed lines on to the existing rails north of birmingham , keeping journey  |||  times  |||  between london and scotland above three hours .
that is seen as the crucial tipping point needed to ensure a switch from planes to trains , a benchmark for the  |||  rail  |||  revolution .
alan duncan , the frontbench tory mp , charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year towards the cost of an orangery he  |||  built  |||  at his constituency home .
the party 's prisons spokesman , who was demoted by david cameron for complaining that mps were living " on rations " ,  |||  increased  |||  his mortgage by gbp 75,000 to build an oak - framed extension to his second home in rutland .
he was allowed to  |||  charge  |||  the extra interest , totalling hundreds of pounds a month , to the taxpayer .
the commons authorities  |||  approved  |||  the claims at the time and they have not been queried by sir thomas legg , who is conducting a review of members ' expenses . last night mr duncan said the claims " could n't be cleaner or simpler " .
mr duncan , one of the richest  |||  members  |||  of parliament , owns a two - storey house in a village in his rutland and melton constituency .
houses near by have sold for almost a million  |||  pounds  |||  .
the ground floor comprises a kitchen , living room and dining room , but the fees office  |||  agreed  |||  that mr duncan needed more space .
neighbours  |||  described  |||  it as a " glasshouse for entertaining " .
the committee cleared him  |||  last  |||  month of breaching the rules after an investigation into his expenses .
in 2004 mr duncan changed the legal security for a gbp 271,406 mortgage from his london property to his constituency  |||  home  |||  , which he had bought in 1991 , the year before he became an mp .
documents released this week  |||  show  |||  that mr duncan was claiming about gbp 1,400 a month in mortgage interest until march last year .
in april , his claims  |||  increased  |||  to more than gbp 1,800 a month .
the  |||  interest  |||  rate on mr duncan 's rbs mortgage did not change in that time , suggesting that all the increase was to fund the gbp 75,000 borrowing .
the latest document release by the commons authorities  |||  show  |||  that mr duncan was continuing to claim gbp 1,250 a month this may .
" basically , it 's being nationalised , you have to live on rations and are  |||  treated  |||  like s * * t. "
he said : " i spend my money on my garden and  |||  claim  |||  a tiny fraction based on what is proper .
and i could  |||  claim  |||  the whole bloody lot , but i do n't . "
the mp , a millionaire from his former career as an oil trader , was first challenged over his expenses in may when it emerged that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden , before agreeing with the fees office that this " could be  |||  considered  |||  excessive " .
an activist dug a hole in the  |||  shape  |||  of a pound sign in mr duncan 's lawn in protest after it was revealed that he claimed gbp 4,000 over three years .
asked about the  |||  increased  |||  mortgage last night , mr duncan said : " it was for capital improvements approved both by the fees office and subsequently by legg . "
it is absolutely straight  |||  down  |||  the line , within the rules , authorised and everything .
beyond , an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity , invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for each day in december ,  |||  using  |||  christmas carols as their theme .
the event started on december 1 , with visitors allowed to view the latest hut from 5. 30pm to 6. 30pm each day , with mince pies and mulled wine laid on for  |||  free  |||  .
he said : " we want to make religion more  |||  relevant  |||  to people in a post - christendom society .
" why do we as a church expect people to come to a strange old  |||  building  |||  ? it 's my feeling the church should come to the people and celebrate in exciting ways .
brighton is such a fantastically  |||  creative  |||  and vibrant place and we are trying to try and represent that through spirituality . "
tens of thousands of people  |||  demonstrated  |||  on saturday to support an ambitious and restrictive agreement in the fight against global warming around the world and in copenhagen , where police made several hundred arrests .
at least thirty thousand people , according to police , and a hundred thousand , according to the organisers , marched in the cold in the  |||  danish  |||  capital outside the united nations climate conference , which is tasked with reaching an agreement by friday that will enter into effect on the 1st of january , 2013 .
for connie hedegaard , the danish climate conference president , the increasing number of climate rallies around the world , illustrated by these protests , has contributed to making the ' political cost ' of a  |||  failure  |||  in copenhagen very high .
the incidents in the danish capital  |||  occurred  |||  shortly after the departure of the main procession , when a group of 300 protesters , clothed entirely in black , broke shop windows with paving and hammers , observed a reporter from the afp .
riot  |||  police  |||  provided an immediate and unhesitant response .
police  |||  announced  |||  a total of 600 to 700 hundred arrests , with most , they report , being members of the ' black blocks ' ; small ultra - violent groups that had notably made an appearance at the nato summit in strasbourg , in the east of france , in april .
the climate justice action ( cja ) coalition , one of the protest organisers , reported conditions whereby hundreds of protesters were arrested " without discrimination , " highlighting that a hundred of them " were still detained in the street on saturday night " handcuffed and  |||  held  |||  in a sitting position despite the extreme cold " .
the protesters stopped about 500 metres short of the  |||  building  |||  without trying to enter .
a stage had been raised to receive the expected speakers before a candlelit vigil , in which the  |||  former  |||  south african archbishop from cape town , desmond tutu would be taking part .
the majority of protesters had arrived by coach and train from the  |||  major  |||  european cities , but many asian protesters , including some chinese and korean , were also present , as well as those from africa .
we are marching on the streets today to  |||  demand  |||  reparations of the ecological debt for the south , explained lidy nacpil , a filipino activist in the jubilee south coalition in copenhagen .
there are rivers drying out in africa ; water courses , where it is  |||  possible  |||  to walk and never was before .
the asia - pacific region , which is home to  |||  numerous  |||  islands , which are particularly vulnerable to the effects of warming , had kicked off the protests .
in manila , several hundred people , mostly students , paraded in red , brandishing banners about the benefits of solar  |||  energy  |||  .
in hong kong , djakarta , and in canada , rallies of several hundred demonstrators were also formed to demand more forceful  |||  action  |||  against climate change .
in france , the protests organised by the " 350 " network brought together several hundred people , notably in paris , marseilles ( in the south ) , lille ( in the north ) , bordeaux ( in the  |||  west  |||  ) , and lyon ( in the east ) .
in  |||  geneva  |||  , dozens of people gathered .
some 131 000 people were called on to take part in this first vote following the georgia - russia war in august 2008 for the control of south ossetia ,  |||  another  |||  secessionist georgian territory recognised by russia .
attendance was at 58 % a few hours before closure , according to abkhazian electoral commission  |||  officials  |||  .
the first provisional results were to be  |||  announced  |||  during the night between saturday and sunday .
the five candidates in the running , among whom the existing president , sergei bagapsh , all categorically reject the idea of a reunification with georgia , which has  |||  condemned  |||  the holding of the vote .
these  |||  elections  |||  are a farce .
for his part , the georgian president , mikheil saakashvili , " regrets that abkhazia has fallen under  |||  total  |||  russian occupation , " declared his spokeswoman , manana manjgaladze .
other than russia , only nicaragua and venezuela have  |||  recognised  |||  the independence of the territory 's 216 000 inhabitants , while the rest of the world considers it a part of georgia illegally occupied by russian troops .
after separating itself from georgia in the 1992-1993 conflict , which saw the loss of several thousand lives , abkhazia is trying to  |||  show  |||  , by means of this election , that it is ready to join the international community .
this process is a stage in our new life , our new era as an independent  |||  state  |||  , declared svetlana kvarchia , a 54 - year - old historian , who confirms having voted for mister bagapsh .
she was among the voters who  |||  came  |||  to the polling station in an attractive white school building with several palm trees at the front in the capital , soukhoumi .
the question of the  |||  russian  |||  domination is at the heart of the presidential debate , in this region gifted with a lush landscape on the black sea .
|||  vast  |||  billboards showing mister bagapsh beside the russian president and prime minister , dmitry medvedev and vladimir putin , are dotted around this small territory of 216 000 inhabitants .
in gali , in the west of the country , the chief of district , beslan archba , reserved a very warm welcome for the  |||  russian  |||  officials who came to oversee the voting .
we , the abkhazian people , are thankful , he said during a small ceremony , alluding to the  |||  support  |||  from moscow , and particularly to the decision to recognise the independence of abkhazia .
i hope that your country will soon be recognised by the united nations , replied alexei ostrovsky , a member of the  |||  russian  |||  parliament , while raising his glass of vodka .
for their part , the opposition represented in the vote by the former vice - president raoul khadjimba and two businessmen , zaous ardzinba and beslan boutba , criticises the agreements made with moscow in the previous year , such as the one  |||  giving  |||  russia control of the abkhazian rail network for the next 10 years .
the fifth  |||  candidate  |||  , vitali bganba , asserts not being in support of the current government or the opposition .
50 % plus one vote is the majority  |||  required  |||  to win the vote .
climate : demonstrations around the world ,  |||  incidents  |||  in copenhagen .
tens of thousands of people the world over marched on saturday to  |||  demand  |||  an ambitious and restrictive agreement at the climate conference in copenhagen , where police were on alert and arrested almost 700 people on the fringes of an imposing rally .
the demonstrators stopped about 500 metres short of the  |||  building  |||  without trying to enter .
a stage had been erected to accommodate the speakers , before a candlelit vigil , with the participation of  |||  former  |||  south african cape town archbishop , desmond tutu .
a few moments after the departure of the procession , a group of several hundred demonstrators , clad entirely in  |||  black  |||  and holding bricks and hammers , broke shop windows , remarked an afp reporter .
riot police immediately surrounded them and intervened in no uncertain terms , throwing several of them to the  |||  ground  |||  .
police  |||  announced  |||  the arrests of 600 to 700 hundred people , adding that they were mainly members of the ' black blocks ' ; small ultra - violent groups that had notably made an appearance at the nato summit in strasbourg , in the east of france , in april .
towards the end of the afternoon a policeman was injured on the jaw by a piece of paving and four cars were set alight  |||  near  |||  a squat during a series of incidents , which led to the arrests of some twenty people , according to police .
we have our eye on the small  |||  extremist  |||  groups , police spokesman henrik jakobsen warned , as the force 's helicopters circled in the sky above .
the majority of demonstrators were of european origin , arriving in coaches and trains from the main  |||  german  |||  cities , from london , from amsterdam , and also from milan .
large numbers of asians , including a few  |||  chinese  |||  and koreans , were also present , as were some africans .
we are taking to the streets today to  |||  demand  |||  the ecological debt be repaid to the south , explained lily nacpil , a filipino activist from the jubilee coalition group in copenhagen .
there are rivers drying out in africa ; water courses , where it is  |||  possible  |||  to walk and never was before .
the asia - pacific region , which is home to  |||  numerous  |||  islands , which are particularly vulnerable to the effects of warming , had kicked off the protests .
in manila , several hundred people , mostly students , paraded in red in front of the capital 's city hall , brandishing banners about the benefits of solar  |||  energy  |||  .
in hong kong and djakarta , rallies of several hundred demonstrators were also formed to demand  |||  action  |||  against climate change .
in france , the protests organised by the " 350 " network brought together several hundred people , notably in paris , marseilles ( in the south ) , lille ( in the north ) , bordeaux ( in the  |||  west  |||  ) , and lyon ( in the east ) .
in  |||  geneva  |||  , dozens of people gathered .
from now on , first year pupils will have four hours per week , and the same programme for a  |||  common  |||  shared culture , states mr. chatel .
the ' es ' and ' l ' courses cannot remain inferior choices behind the 's ' course , he continues ,  |||  highlighting  |||  that " i have not heard many historians or academics expressing indignance at the absence of history - geography in the technical sixth forms either . "
on saturday , an ifop ( french public opinion institute ) poll appearing in l'humanité revealed that nearly seven out of ten ( 69 % ) french people disapproved of the government project to terminate compulsory teaching of history - geography in technical sixth forms . many academics and teachers also criticised this suppression , as have the  |||  left  |||  and some right - wing representatives .
on the other hand , the  |||  minister  |||  added that there was " no question " of eliminating the 's ' course philosophy .
luc chatel also  |||  defended  |||  the teachers ' education reforms , just as 16 organisations ( students and associations ) called for a day of protest on tuesday to demonstrate against the project , which , in their opinion , sacrifices the educational training of future teachers .
furthermore , they will cover in - class placements throughout the m 2 year , and will then be in  |||  front  |||  of pupils for a year as student teachers .
if you add up all the placement work proposed before the exam you already end up with more presence in front of students , which equates to over 300 hours , he  |||  continued  |||  .
finally , the minister indicates that he will be putting forward " the individual 's  |||  right  |||  to education ; something that does not exist in national education " .
he also reaffirms the plan to abolish the  |||  school  |||  map " by 2012 " .
at normale supérieure ( one of france 's top schools ) ,  |||  experts  |||  have 15 minutes to change opinions on climate
fifteen minutes to talk about what is at stake at the copenhagen summit : that was the  |||  challenge  |||  taken up on saturday morning by jean jouzel , vice - president of the intergovernmental group of climate evolution experts ( giec ) invited by the ecole normale supérieure in rue d'ulm ( paris ) .
jean jouzel , nobel peace prize winner , inaugurated the first of the conferences entitled " ernest " , a day composed of a series of 15 - minute lectures from experts , filmed and  |||  open  |||  to the public , noted an afp reporter .
on the subject of global warming , " we could go on for hours , but we can also cover the key objectives in a few minutes " , jean jouzel  |||  told  |||  the afp , who made his presentation without notes , but with graphical aids , to an audience of around fifty .
the video footage from the conferences will be available online on the  |||  school  |||  's website starting the 15th of december .
the next " ernest " day is  |||  planned  |||  for february , followed by others on a bimonthly basis .
late payments : anger from prison guards , action  |||  planned  |||
prison guard unions called for a "  |||  general  |||  rally " on friday to demand payment of their bonuses and overtime before the end of the year holidays , having seen it pushed into january for budgetary reasons .
and the first prison guard union , union fédérale autonome pénitentiaire ( ufap / unsa ) , " calls for  |||  general  |||  rallying ( . . . ) to re - awaken the discontent and anger " .
the penitentiary administration 's management and the justice ministry explain that overtime has  |||  increased  |||  considerably in 2009 and was not fully covered in the budget , but assures that the outstanding balances will be settled in january .
the chancery stated near the end of the day that michèle alliot - marie had  |||  sent  |||  a communication to the prison guard unions guaranteeing the payment would be made next month .
i am not ignoring the efforts made by the  |||  staff  |||  for the functioning and modernisation of our prison system , writes the minister of justice in this communication .
i have asked the penitentiary administration management to put in place , without delay , a set of measures to ensure that this situation , caused by a  |||  poor  |||  evaluation of the number of additional work hours , does not repeat itself in the future , adds mrs. alliot - marie .
the december pay packet will therefore be slim , except for management staff , who benefit from the so - called target and position - related bonuses , critics the ufap / unsa ,  |||  saying  |||  " budgetary constraints are a convenient excuse " .
it is an absolute scandal , complains the inter - regional union from marseilles , announcing its decision to boycott " all  |||  meetings  |||  and convocations " until further notice .
at a time when our goals and responsibilities are being expanded , but our  |||  staff  |||  numbers are not , it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff 's salaries , judges the cgt - pénitentiaire de bordeaux .
according to the unions , the situation is not the same in all regions , with some being worse off than  |||  others  |||  .
but in any case , the balance is not there , observes jean - françois forget ,  |||  general  |||  secretary of ufap .
for  |||  christmas  |||  , obama says he gives " nicer stuff " than he receives
the  |||  american  |||  president , barack obama , who is preparing for his first family christmas at the white house , intimates to tv icon oprah winfrey that he has one simple rule when it comes to presents : " i give nicer stuff than i get " .
even bo , the  |||  family  |||  's little four - legged friend , will be joining in .
and michelle obama feigned indignance , countering her husband 's claims about the quality of the gifts he receives : " no way ; i gave you good gifts  |||  last year  |||  " , she teased the president .
absolutely , he had to concede before jokingly retorting : " who  |||  gave  |||  you this ? " , pointing at the first lady 's pearl necklace .
i remember a time when i met my father , who had come to visit us for  |||  christmas  |||  , and he gave me a basketball , said the president .
it was only much later in my life that i  |||  realised  |||  that he had given me the ball .
i had no idea how to organise a house , so i had lined up all the furniture against the wall , rather than arranging them around the fireplace , but i adored that  |||  little  |||  dollhouse , said michelle obama .
johnny hallyday was re - operated on in los angeles due to significant " lesions " after an operation in france , but the situation is " under control " according to his entourage , while rtl claims that the singer has been placed in an artificial coma to  |||  avoid  |||  pain and complications .
the 66 - year - old rocker was re - operated on in the night between wednesday and thursday at the cedars - sinaï hospital in los angeles after american doctors  |||  noted  |||  " lesions resulting from the operation " for the slipped disc undergone in paris on november 26th , his press office announced in paris , adding that the lesions had " warranted a repair operation " .
the singer 's press office , however , wanted to be reassuring , stating that the situation was " under control " , while announcing that a new  |||  medical  |||  bulletin would be communicated within 48 hours .
according to rtl , partner for the singer 's first tour , however , johnny hallyday may have been put into an artificial coma to  |||  avoid  |||  " pain and complications " .
it will only be in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the state of the patient , once he has at least one eye  |||  open  |||  , added rtl .
rtl also claims that " according to  |||  certain  |||  sources " , no drain was fitted after the first operation in paris .
the rocker had been operated on for a slipped disc at the international  |||  clinic  |||  at parc monceau .
the operation , scheduled several days in advance , had been carried out by the neuro - surgeon stéphane delajoux , a well -  |||  known  |||  doctor in artist circles .
he was not  |||  available  |||  to comment on rtl 's information on thursday evening .
following the operation that he carried out on johnny hallyday , the singer was taken on monday to the cedars - sinaï hospital for an  |||  infection  |||  stemming from the operation .
the singer , eddy mitchell , a  |||  close  |||  friend of johnny hallyday , said on rtl on thursday that his friend was going through " a bad patch " , but assured everyone that he had " no worries " about the rocker , who is a " fighter " .
he had called me just before leaving for los angeles , and i told him that it was crazy , because taking a 12 - hour flight after that  |||  kind  |||  of operation is not realistic , said eddy mitchell .
wednesday evening , the singer 's  |||  producer  |||  , jean - claude camus , had wanted to be reassuring , stating that johnny hallyday " was reacting satisfactorily to the antibiotics " and that the infection was being " contained " .
mr. camus had also said to have spoken with laeticia , the singer 's wife , and not to have noticed any signs of  |||  worry  |||  .
but health problems for the singer have only multiplied since he was hospitalised for nine days in july after a  |||  fall  |||  on his yacht .
two months later , to the surprise of all , johnny hallyday had revealed having had a "  |||  minor  |||  colonic cancer " operation , then a slight infection .
at the end of september , the singer resumed as planned his  |||  long  |||  " tour 66 " , billed as his final goodbye tour .
however , since then ,  |||  every  |||  health problem is heavily commented on . fans and reporters have noticed the singer 's trouble in moving around on stage .
in mid -  |||  november  |||  , his entourage even had to deny further hospitalisation .
the frenchman , frédérick bousquet , triple medal - holder in the long course 2009  |||  world  |||  championship , pulled off an international title for a distance he particularly favours , the 50m freestyle , at the euro - 2009 short course event in istanbul on thursday .
the first day of this competition , where full - length swimsuits are permitted for the last time , has seen only three world records beaten , whereas a wave of them was  |||  expected  |||  .
a regret for bousquet , who had his sight set on the 50m freestyle world  |||  record  |||  , for which he holds the long course title ( 20.94 ) .
in one of the two high - profile swimming events , the 50m freestyle , it was the 28 - year - old frenchman who made his mark with a time of 20.53 in a  |||  final  |||  , where ten swimmers started instead of the usual eight - a first at the international level .
one can always dream of better , and i had actually stated that , if the world record was in my  |||  reach  |||  , i would certainly attempt it .
having unleashed 238 world records since february 2008 , these swimsuits will end their epic story in istanbul , which had also  |||  seen  |||  the first ones in 1999 , during the same competition .
the use of these swimsuits did not assist the  |||  german  |||  , rome 's long course two - time world champion this summer , paul biedermann , on this occasion , where world records were at stake .
the young swimmer did not succeed in reducing the  |||  record  |||  he currently holds in the 400m freestyle ( 3:32.77 ) , but did , nevertheless , make an impression by achieving his second personal best time ( 3:34.55 ) , ahead of the russian , nikita lobintsev ( 3:35.75 ) and the dane , mads glaesner ( 3:36.82 ) .
i did not give it my all in this  |||  race  |||  .
i knew that i could not achieve a world  |||  record  |||  , but i managed to defend my title and have accomplished my mission .
lobintsev will be a strong rival in the  |||  future  |||  , explained biedermann .
usa : a sarcophagus panel  |||  belonging  |||  to zola fetches 1.5 million usd
the marble " depicting four dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor , surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes , is a rare piece ; there are only five of them in the  |||  world  |||  " , florent heintz , vice - president of art auctions for roman and egyptian antiquities , had explained to the afp on tuesday .
it was  |||  sold  |||  among around a hundred other lots .
the auction is still  |||  going  |||  on , but this lot is certainly the one , which has got buyers bidding most so far , commented sotheby 's spokesman to the afp , dan abernethy .
the panel remained in the  |||  famous  |||  collection of the borghese family in rome for nearly 300 years , then it successively appeared with the french actress , cécile sorel , who had made it a feature of her bathroom in her private paris mansion , then paul reynaud , a minister in france 's 3rd republic and briefly the council 's chairman before marshal pétain 's accession to power .
that left a grey area of about fifty  |||  years  |||  .
zelaya 's departure  |||  attempt  |||  from honduras to mexico aborted
having arrived on wednesday in el salvador to bring back mr. zelaya , the mexican government plane returned to its original location , according to a source from the  |||  general  |||  directorate of migrations .
but the president refused , because he wanted to travel to mexico as the incumbent  |||  head  |||  of state and an invited guest .
i could  |||  stay  |||  here ten years , i have my guitar here , added the deposed president while playing a few chords , having taken refuge at the brazilian embassy in tegucigalpa for the last two and a half months .
the mexican embassy presented us with a request for safe passage , but , unfortunately , we could not  |||  accept  |||  it because it did not contain an asylum request , the coup government interior minister , oscar raul matute , had declared on wednesday on honduran hrn radio .
i am not requesting asylum from any country , manuel zelaya had answered in an interview on the telesur channel ,  |||  based  |||  in caracas .
any departure from honduras would have to be as the president of the honduran people , he had  |||  emphasised  |||  .
the rumours of mr. zelaya 's departure had , on wednesday , mobilised the partisans of the deposed president , who gathered around the brazilian embassy , where military forces  |||  reinforced  |||  their position .
the brazilian foreign minister , celso amorim , criticised the coup government 's  |||  position  |||  .
this  |||  demonstrates  |||  the marginal character of this government in relation with international standards , he asserted .
exiled to costa rica , he had made a surprise  |||  return  |||  on september 21st and had taken refuge at the brazilian embassy .
the coup president , roberto micheletti , has managed to organise a presidential  |||  election  |||  on the 29th of november to replace mr. zelaya .
porfirio lobo was elected in the controversial vote , which was  |||  recognised  |||  by the united states , but was contested by latin american countries such as venezuela , argentina , and brazil .
three days later , congress voted by a landslide against mr. zelaya 's  |||  return  |||  to power for the remainder of his term up to january 27th .
wall street rises , the commercial  |||  balance  |||  of the us feeds optimism
the new york stock exchange finished higher on thursday , as american commercial equilibrium figures indicate a return of activity in the  |||  united  |||  states and with its partners : the dow gained 0.67 % , and the nasdaq 0.33 % .
according to the  |||  final  |||  closing figures , the dow jones industrial average rose by 68.78 points to 10 405.83 points , and the nasdaq , with a technology dominance , rose by 7.13 points to 2 190.06 points .
the broader standard &  |||  poor  |||  's 500 index had a result of 0.58 % ( 6.40 points ) taking it to 1 102.35 points .
we have good news  |||  coming  |||  from various sides of the economy , assessed lindsey piegza from ftn financial .
peter cardillo of avalon partners thinks that investors have concentrated particularly on america 's commercial balance figures , " which  |||  show  |||  an improvement in activity in the fourth quarter " .
the us  |||  commercial  |||  deficit dropped by 7.6 % in october , compared to september , to 32.9 billion dollars .
analysts were expecting the opposite , a deepening of the  |||  deficit  |||  .
both imports and exports  |||  increased  |||  .
the big news is the  |||  increase  |||  in trade volumes , especially in the export of goods , which reflects the economical growth of the commercial partners of the united states , commented christopher cornell from the research company economy.com .
in contrast , new unemployment claims in the united states have increased beyond all expectations in the past week , to  |||  reach  |||  474 000 claims .
however , in the  |||  last  |||  four weeks , the average number of new employment seekers " has fallen to its lowest in a year " , highlighted scott marcouiller from wells fargo advisors .
the bond market has  |||  fallen  |||  .
treasury 10 - year bond yields have grown to 3.482 % against 3.423 % on tuesday evening , and 30 - year bond yields are at 4.492 % against 4.408 % the  |||  previous  |||  evening .
cuba : hundreds of government supporters speak out against the " ladies in  |||  white  |||  "
several hundred cuban pro - government demonstrators spoke out on thursday against political prisoners ' wives , who had gathered in havana for international human rights day , and prevented another demonstration , for which around a dozen dissidents were  |||  arrested  |||  .
around forty " white ladies " , wives and those  |||  close  |||  to the political prisoners , were jeered at in the street by supporters of raul castro 's government as they were marching towards the centre of the capital to demand the liberation of the political prisoners , observed an afp reporter .
these latter were escorted by plainclothes agents , who had come to "  |||  ensure  |||  their protection " .
the previous evening , a  |||  similar  |||  demonstration had taken place against the " ladies in white " in havana without anyone being injured or arrested .
however , in the vedado district of havana , a dozen dissidents , who were also preparing to demonstrate thursday for the international human rights day , were arrested by plainclothes police ,  |||  reported  |||  an afp journalist .
dissident arrests under  |||  similar  |||  circumstances normally only last a few hours .
unusually , cuban television covered the demonstration of pro - government supporters against the "  |||  anti  |||  - revolutionaries " on thursday .
cuba , lead by a  |||  single  |||  party , the communist party , is regularly accused by european or american ngos of flouting rights and liberties , notably those of the freedom of expression .
a crazed man armed with two knives has  |||  killed  |||  a man in his eighties and wounded five other people in the city centre of clichy - la - garenne ( hauts - de - seine ) , during rush hour , towards the end of thursday .
we have learned from witnesses and from police that ,  |||  according  |||  to the investigation 's initial findings , the attacker , aged 28 , appears to have struck an eighty - year - old with two knives for reasons that remain unclear , in or at the front of a pharmacy at 85 boulevard jean - jaurès .
the first two victims , gravely wounded , were  |||  admitted  |||  to the hospital , where the eighty - year - old man died .
the days of the other injured person may be numbered , as vital organs have apparently been  |||  affected  |||  , according to police sources .
the pregnant woman was subsequently taken ill and was hospitalised " in a state of shock " , according to one police  |||  source  |||  .
he is reported to have wounded two passers - by , apparently at random : one thirty - year - old , and one forty - year - old , the latter  |||  severely  |||  .
several passers - by , including some youngsters , attempted to overpower the madman , according to witness reports  |||  collected  |||  by the afp .
i saw a guy of about thirty with a  |||  green  |||  jacket .
still on jean - jaurès boulevard , outside  |||  number  |||  61 , two town policemen , one of whom was the chief , attempted to arrest the armed man and were injured by punches , according to police sources .
the events  |||  took place  |||  on one of clichy - la - garenne 's main streets , where many local businesses operate .
some passers - by  |||  came  |||  to tell me that there was someone injured outside .
i went out , saw a 70 - year - old on the  |||  ground  |||  , put the person in the recovery position , then i noticed a severe wound on the abdomen , frédéric allione , a 35 - year - old pharmacist , told the afp .
five minutes later , a second person arrived , aged  |||  around  |||  thirty , with knife wounds .
national police officers were the ones who  |||  arrested  |||  the man , who was not carrying any identification documents .
the madman was taken to a  |||  hospital  |||  on thursday evening .
he had not yet had a chance to speak after being taken into  |||  custody  |||  .
a police  |||  source  |||  did not exclude the possibility of him being committed to a psychiatric hospital .
according to another police source , six policemen were  |||  needed  |||  to subdue the man at the police station in clichy , where he was taken .
he was " in a state of hyperexcitement " as are " all crazed people of this kind , whose strength  |||  increases  |||  tenfold under its effect " .
usa :  |||  polanski  |||  's lawyer calls afresh for proceedings to be dropped
the lawyer of the franco - polish film director , roman polanski , called again in los angeles on thursday ( california , western  |||  united  |||  states ) , for the abandonment of proceedings against his client , who is currently under house arrest in switzerland for a vice case that is over 30 years old .
chad hummel , the lawyer for the director of " the pianist " cited  |||  grave  |||  errors in the procedures at the time of the events in 1977 , in front of three judges at the court of appeal of california 's second district .
this discussion had been revealed in the documentary " roman polanski :  |||  wanted  |||  and desired " , the words coming straight from the prosecutor in question , david wells .
however , mr. wells had eventually  |||  declared  |||  that he had " lied " to the author of the documentary at the end of september .
in the event of the court 's refusal to abandon proceedings , mr. hummel called for a trial to be  |||  held  |||  , which would allow him to present evidence to back his arguments .
the prosecution , for its part , has re - iterated its argument , already formed in the first instance , that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously looked at while roman polanski did not  |||  present  |||  himself in court .
the 76 - year - old filmmaker had fled the  |||  united  |||  states before his sentence had been passed for " unlawful sexual relations " with a 13 - year - old minor .
he has not set foot in the  |||  united  |||  states since .
the deputy prosecutor for los angeles county , phyllis asayama , therefore declared that  |||  roman  |||  polanski " must be present at the hearing " .
in her view , the filmmaker " is  |||  asking  |||  a favour from the court , while at the same time showing disregard for its authority " .
one of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to return their verdict -- has also  |||  emphasised  |||  " that there are other alternatives to fleeing " .
mr. hummel was not the only one to request that proceedings against  |||  roman  |||  polanski be abandoned .
the lawyer of samantha geimer , the victim , also called  |||  once again  |||  for an end to the proceedings .
reminding that her client can no longer stand to be harassed with every resurfacing of the polanski case , she  |||  added  |||  : " no one in this room can claim that this was a just procedure .
roman polanski was arrested on the 26th of september in switzerland on an  |||  american  |||  warrant .
after more than two months behind bars , he was put under  |||  house  |||  arrest at his chalet in gstaad , pending his possible extradition .
wall  |||  street  |||  closes without momentum , slowed by a strengthening dollar
the new york stock exchange closed with no particular heading on friday , in a market torn between better than  |||  expected  |||  indicators in the united states and a strengthening dollar : the dow jones gained 0.63 % but the nasdaq dropped 0.03 % .
according to final closing figures , the dow jones industrial average has risen by 65.67 points to 10 471.50 points , whereas the nasdaq , with a technology predominance , fell by 0.55  |||  point  |||  to 2 190.31 points .
the wider standard &  |||  poor  |||  's 500 has itself advanced by 0.37 % ( 4.06 points ) to 1 106.41 points .
frankly , the market is very  |||  calm  |||  , observes mace blicksilver of marblehead asset management .
it remains within a  |||  narrow  |||  margin ; trading volumes have become very weak , and i think that this will remain the case until the end of the year .
the trend was supported by the publication of better than expected  |||  economic  |||  indicators , which " have contributed to improving market opinion in relation to the robustness of the economic recovery " , summarised charles schwab 's analysts .
in the united states , retail  |||  sales  |||  have increased by 1.3 % in november , for the second month in a row , and far more than predicted .
moreover , the confidence of american consumers has clearly bounced  |||  back  |||  in december , to 73.4 against 67.4 the previous month , according to preliminary estimates from michigan university 's index .
treasury 10 - year bond yields have grown to 3.540 % against 3.482 % on tuesday evening , and 30 - year bond yields are at 4.497 % against 4.492 % the  |||  previous  |||  evening .
miss world pageant once again in  |||  south africa  |||
after a month - long trek across  |||  south africa  |||  , the 112 candidates for the title of miss world are preparing to enter the final straight on saturday to make their dream come true : to be voted the most beautiful woman in the world in front of a billion television viewers .
during this grand beauty congregation organised for the second consecutive year  |||  around  |||  johannesburg , five of them have already landed their tickets to the semi - final .
miss japan , eruza sasaki , perla beltran acosta of mexico , mariatu kargbo of sierra leone , kaiane aldorino from gibraltar , and yanbing ma from canada have been  |||  elected  |||  miss world sportswoman or also miss world top model during their african stay .
to  |||  visit  |||  beautiful cities like port elizabeth , durban , and cape town is extraordinary .
i saw so many  |||  things  |||  and i have so much new experience , said miss of sierra leone .
this  |||  competition  |||  , which is taking place in south africa for the ninth time , will be transmitted live on saturday from midrand , north of johannesburg , starting at 17:00 ( 15:00 gmt ) .
the  |||  experience  |||  was fascinating .
for the young  |||  russian  |||  , her second visit to south africa has been made memorable by the many talks with candidates and the re - discovery " of landscapes in this country that take your breath away " .
after a month of galas , rehearsals , press meetings , and safaris , the miss candidates are concentrating on the  |||  competition  |||  .
the indian pooja chopra hopes to follow in the footsteps of priyanka chopra ,  |||  elected  |||  in 2000 and present at this vote , as well as those of aishwarya rai in 1994 , both of whom have become stars of bollywood .
it is the dream of  |||  every  |||  woman to be crowned the most beautiful woman in the world , but it is not all about appearance .
we are ambassadors for our countries and i want to return  |||  home  |||  with the crown , asserts miss india with a broad smile .
south africa showed that it could  |||  welcome  |||  the world with a warmth and pride that is difficult to better , affirms julia morley , president of miss world .
the candidates went on safari , as they did  |||  last year  |||  , visited the famous township of soweto , but this time by bicycle , and sampled the local cuisine .
exceptionally , they also met the south african  |||  president  |||  , jacob zuma , who shook their hands .
their most beautiful memory will probably be the world cup draw in cape town ( southwest ) for football in june 2010 , a way for the country to promote the event a  |||  little  |||  more .
i will without a doubt be returning for the 2010  |||  world  |||  cup , enthuses miss italy , alice taticchi .
the  |||  news  |||  about johnny hallyday " is very positive " , according to son david
the  |||  news  |||  about johnny hallyday " is very positive " , assures his son , david , on friday arriving at the airport in los angeles , where he was to be by his father 's bedside , who has been in hospital for several days .
the news is very  |||  positive  |||  .
the singer was " put in an artificial coma tonight in los angeles for comfort reasons , to  |||  prevent  |||  his suffering , and to allow his treatment to be administered " , indicated the press service .
johnny hallyday had already been put in an artificial coma by doctors at the cedars - sinaï hospital in los angeles , where he had been admitted on monday for an infection stemming from a slipped disc operation on the 26th of november in  |||  paris  |||  .
his wife , laeticia , went on friday morning to the los angeles  |||  french  |||  high school , where their daughter jade is enrolled , to attend a school performance , observed an afp photographer .
i heard talk of  |||  possible  |||  legal proceedings to come , he said .
i had this doctor on the phone in person , and he  |||  assured  |||  me that there was no problem for this trip , which shocked me , as i , myself , have had two slipped discs , he added .
shortly before , on rtl , he had indicated that the singer apparently " had left without a drain or  |||  anything  |||  " , following his paris operation .
dr stéphane delajoux is well -  |||  known  |||  in artistic circles .
he had operated on the actress marie trintignant in vilnius a few days  |||  before  |||  her death at a clinic in neuilly - sur - seine , where he practiced at the time .
in 2007 , he had also operated on the actress charlotte gainsbourg to resorb a haematoma ,  |||  following  |||  a cerebral haemorrhage .
after several days of  |||  silence  |||  , dr. stéphane delajoux made an announcement on friday through his solicitor , david koubbi .
the operation " was not haemorrhagic and  |||  therefore  |||  did not required a drain to be fitted " , he added .
in any case , the singer 's tour , for whom health problems have been multiplying since the summer , would  |||  seem  |||  to be on hold .
clearly , resuming the tour on the 8th of january [ in amiens ] as  |||  planned  |||  seems very soon , declared mr. camus .
the udf alliance speaks out and orders the new  |||  centre  |||  party to stop using its acronym
the udf alliance ,  |||  controlled  |||  by françois bayrou 's democratic movement ( modem ) , reacted on friday to the buy - out bid made by the new centre 's president , hervé morin , for the acronym of the former giscardian party , by ordering him not to use it under any circumstances , threatening legal action otherwise .
hervé morin announced publicly that he intended to recoup the udf acronym , ruling that françois bayrou was not worthy of its political heritage , having extended his hand to the  |||  left  |||  .
the defence minister , whose party is partner to the ump , had in fact  |||  planned  |||  to confirm this strategy on saturday before the nc 's national council .
in support of his  |||  move  |||  , he received backing from deputy hervé de charette ( ex - ump switched to nc ) , who claims his ownership of the udf trademark by being the first to record it in 2004 at the national industrial property institute .
however , friday evening , the udf alliance 's office , headed by françois bayrou 's friends , who do not plan to give up possession , has come out of silence to launch an attack against the deputy , ordering him not to use the acronym , and to transfer the trademark 's ownership to them , otherwise  |||  threatening  |||  legal action .
in the  |||  last  |||  few days , you have stepped up the number of declarations indicating that you were going to propose political action to regain the udf acronym , the alliance writes in a communication signed by 19 out of the 24 members of the office , including françois bayrou and marielle de sarnez from the modem , as well as the senator , jean arthuis , from the centre alliance .
he also  |||  requests  |||  that hervé de charette " transfer ownership of the trademark to its rightful owners " .
if you failed to do this , the matter would be referred to the courts to ensure that the law and the legitimate rights of udf members were  |||  respected  |||  , warn the document 's signatories .
the new centre , according to them , has therefore no  |||  right  |||  to the use of the udf acronym ( union for french democracy ) .
they also remind that the udf 's last assembly voted in 2007 for its union with the modem for three years , and for the creation of an office charged with  |||  defending  |||  " the material and moral interests " of the body founded by valéry giscard d'estaing .
this incident is turning into a major offence , they state , before adding ironically about the nc 's strategy that : " in our opinion , in politics as in real life , it is more dignified to make one 's own name rather than try to become somebody by fraudulently acquiring a name we have no  |||  right  |||  to " .
liliane bettencourt case : françois - marie banier will be  |||  tried  |||  for " abuse of weakness "
the photographer , 62 , known for his photographs of the stars , will be tried on the 15th and 16th of april 2010 for " abuse of weakness " , an offence that carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a 375 000 euro  |||  fine  |||  .
the decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in this case , which is turning into a worthy  |||  family  |||  saga involving one of the richest families in france , where mother and daughter are torn apart , while at the reins of the l'oréal cosmetics empire .
however , the 15th magistrate 's court has also ordered a combined expert  |||  medical  |||  opinion of liliane bettencourt , aged 87 , to be led by three doctors .
for his part , the lawyer of françoise bettencourt - meyers , olivier metzner , congratulated himself on the  |||  court  |||  's decision .
for two years , liliane bettencourt 's daughter and only child has engaged in taking to court the case against françois - marie banier , the photographer and all - round artist ,  |||  whom  |||  she accuses of profiting for years from her mother 's weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations , in the form of cheques , life insurance contracts , or works of art .
as far as she is concerned , liliane bettencourt has always refuted having been manipulated by the photographer , who she considers a long - standing  |||  friend  |||  .
i have been  |||  unable  |||  to speak to françoise since her marriage " .
liliane bettencourt " is fully  |||  capable  |||  of participating in legal proceedings , she is not under protection and does not have a guardian .
nobody needs to act on her behalf " , affirms the public prosecution 's  |||  representative  |||  , marie - christine daubigney .
the court  |||  determined  |||  that it would make a ruling once the case concerning the admissibility of mrs. bettencourt - meyers 's claim had taken place .
a management  |||  revolution  |||  or the end of competitive intelligence ?
for over ten years , the management 's attitude in  |||  large  |||  enterprises towards their employees reflects the position of enterprises and their consumers before the marketing revolution : employees should be made to adhere to " values " dictated from above just as it was in the past , when products dreamed up by the factory 's engineers were dropped on the consumer .
a demobilisation of  |||  employees  |||  can lead to terminal demoralisation .
demobilisation gravely compromises the  |||  development  |||  of an organisation 's strategic functions , notably in r&d , but even more so in competitive intelligence .
indeed , ci " demands from all sides concerned ( . . . ) a proactive approach and a long - term vision " ; it requires from employees a commitment that is entirely contradicted by  |||  authoritarian  |||  management methods .
for this reason , we are calling for a  |||  management  |||  revolution , which would consist in placing employees at the centre of an enterprise 's concerns alongside consumers .
the very relative usefulness of internal  |||  opinion  |||  surveys
will internal  |||  opinion  |||  surveys - such as those given by orange to its employees - stimulate this revolution in managerial methods ?
- next , because authoritarianism - a disease of  |||  power  |||  - grows proportionally with the magnitude of its own failures .
they adopt , for intellectual convenience , the old behaviourist theory , which has recently been re - awakened by the " neuro - sciences " of the united states that have been widely and silently diffused by business institutes and the  |||  media  |||  .
in this way , by suggesting that " levers " [ sic ] can be pulled for the commitment of management staff , a recent ipsos survey published on figaro.fr cradles leaders into a  |||  position  |||  of mechanistic governance , which is unsuited to the world of today .
|||  identify  |||  and quantify mobilisation factors
in contrast , the management revolution  |||  needed  |||  for the correct functioning of modern enterprises supposes the adoption of a finalistic vision of human behaviour .
it consists in the integration , within all management strategies and practices , of a fundamental admission : for employees , commitment to the enterprise is only  |||  possible  |||  if it is clearly perceived as a means to realising a part of their dreams , their ambitions , and their plans .
currently , only studies produced through motivation factor analysis adopt the  |||  concept  |||  of employee motivation .
they thereby create a favourable terrain for the concerted development of robust and  |||  effective  |||  competitive intelligence .
oslo speech : the " just war " earns obama praise from the  |||  right  |||
the american  |||  right  |||  paid tribute to the speech given the previous evening in oslo by barack obama , satisfied that the nobel peace prize 2009 had defended the concept of a " just war " against the enemies of the united states .
mr. obama , who has inherited the two wars from his predecessor , george w. bush , in iraq and afghanistan , applied himself on thursday in oslo to justifying resorting to force , a way to explain his decision to  |||  send  |||  30 000 additional troops to afghanistan nine days earlier .
i found his speech to be really very good , approved the former speaker in the house of representatives , who had particularly valued the  |||  mention  |||  that " evil does exist in the world " in the presidential discourse .
from certain viewpoints , i found this speech to be of historic significance ,  |||  declared  |||  mr. gingrich , during an interview for the radio show " the takeaway " .
the former representative ,  |||  considered  |||  by some a possible candidate for the republican inauguration of the 2012 presidential elections , was delighted to see " a president from the left " remind the noble committee members " that they would not be free and in a position to award a peace prize if resorting to force had not been an option " .
for michael gerson , a former writer for george w. bush and re - converted columnist for the washington post , mr. obama has given " a very  |||  american  |||  speech " .
among the few unconvinced right - wingers , a hawkish character from the bush era , the former un ambassador , john bolton , described the speech as " drab , turgid , and uninspired " on the national review online 's  |||  website  |||  .
to the president 's left , the democratic representative dennis kucinich was alarmed to see barack obama justify resorting to  |||  force  |||  .
the los angeles times , still of the opinion that the nobel prize had been prematurely awarded to mr. obama , described his address as " a blockbuster " , even for a speaker that is  |||  known  |||  for his talent .
the oslo speech " should serve as a roadmap for guiding international decisions made on conflicts , poverty and oppression " , enthused the californian  |||  newspaper  |||  .
mr. obama " made the speech that was  |||  needed  |||  " , reports the new york times , judging it " both sombre and edifying " .
road freight : three marathons for one agreement to  |||  save  |||  christmas deliveries
following three marathon sessions of negotiations , transport unions and the tlf , the only employer 's organisation to have  |||  remained  |||  to the end , reached an agreement on friday evening that will end the strike order and the threat on christmas deliveries .
during the signing on friday evening , transport  |||  secretary  |||  dominique bussereau was " delighted " with the agreement after several rounds of negotiations on wednesday morning .
and this ,  |||  despite  |||  three employers ' organisations ( fntr , unostra , otre ) having slammed the door .
however , it took a further six hours from a  |||  meeting  |||  that started at 11am for everyone to be in agreement , and for the text to be signed at 6pm .
the document allows for a 4 %  |||  increase  |||  in salaries for the lowest ones ( in local and regional road transport ) , and a 2.9 % increase for higher ones ( international transport ) .
this evening we will give the  |||  order  |||  to our campaigners not to form blockades or picket at delivery depots .
there may , however , always be a few difficult ones , who remain uncooperative , he  |||  added  |||  .
philippe grillot , president of the tlf , paid tribute to " a good agreement " , even if it was "  |||  difficult  |||  to concede the increases on the higher salaries given international competition " .
according to him , the  |||  increases  |||  will be of the order of 170 euros per month for the lower salaries and from 100 to 120 euros for the higher ones .
it is a common sense agreement , respecting the workers ,  |||  declared  |||  maxime dumont ( cfdt ) , while thierry douine ( cftc ) praised it as " a historic agreement " .
as for richard jaubert ( cgt ) , he described it as " an  |||  acceptable  |||  compromise " .
mr. bussereau reminded everyone that " a 100 million euro cut in employers ' charges " had been the  |||  subject  |||  of a government amendment in corrective financial legislation for 2009 , voted on in the night from thursday to friday at the national assembly .
the government will ask that the senate  |||  vote  |||  on it " in the same timeframe " .
the signature from the tlf allows the agreement to be  |||  applied  |||  in the first instance to all the companies that are members of the organisation , and secondly , to the whole profession , subject to it being extended by the minister for labour .
the fntr called it a " sham " , because the 100 million euros " had already been promised to the sector in  |||  compensation  |||  for part of the carbon tax " .
the transport secretary urgently  |||  forced  |||  us to the negotiating table , not with the aim of a two - sided review , but to avoid upsetting the turkey - eaters this christmas , deplores the unostra .
for the otre , the agreement risks " digging the graves of a large number of the sector 's smes over the  |||  next  |||  12 months " .
rer a : disruptions this weekend ,  |||  unions  |||  unhappy with ratp proposals
the operation of the interchange with the sncf will be  |||  suspended  |||  at nanterre préfecture , forcing passengers to change trains .
the rer a runs through the parisian conurbation from  |||  west  |||  to east .
the ratp segment  |||  runs  |||  from saint - germain - en - laye and nanterre to boissy - saint - léger and marne - la - vallée .
on friday , approximately one out of two trains ran at peak times , with almost no trains at all during off - peak periods , as  |||  planned  |||  .
at boissy - saint - léger ( val - de - marne ) , jack nbakina , a 29 - year - old engineer , explained that he had gotten up " an hour and a half earlier , to be  |||  sure  |||  of arriving on time " .
the rer a trains operated by the sncf to or from cergy - le - haut were departing or arriving from saint - lazare  |||  station  |||  , where they link with the metro .
new general meetings for strikers will be  |||  held  |||  on saturday and sunday , which will review the results , seen as " poor " by the unions , of a meeting with management held on friday afternoon .
it is not what the drivers , who are  |||  demanding  |||  the bonus they are owed , want , according to thierry garon ( sud ) .
a new  |||  meeting  |||  is scheduled on monday for " a wider review of the conditions of practice for the profession " , the ratp elaborated .
prompting the unions to remark further that the  |||  company  |||  " did not care about its weekend passengers " .
that is when management , which had until then refused to enter into any  |||  discussions  |||  during the strike , had suggested the meeting " in a motion to calm the situation " .
the dispute is threatening to extend to rer b on tuesday ,  |||  following  |||  the submission of an advance notice by the unsa and the indépendants groups .
the unions are  |||  demanding  |||  a bonus of 120 euros ( unsa ) to 150 euros , with a 30 - euro variable band ( cgt , fo , cfdt , sud , indépendants ) and are complaining of the deterioration in work conditions on this line serving a million passengers every day .
the rer drivers , all in the later stages of their careers , are paid a gross salary of 2200 to 2700 euros as well as 600 to 650 euros of bonus pay for split shifts , sundays and  |||  holidays  |||  .
|||  turkish  |||  justice bans the pro - kurd party , a decision laden with consequences
the  |||  turkish  |||  constitutional court returned a verdict on friday for the dissolution of the country 's main pro - kurd party , a decision which was immediately followed by angry protests within the kurdish community in the southeast of the country and in istanbul .
the decision is likely to greatly complicate the government 's work , as it has just recently made positive gestures towards the kurdish community in an  |||  attempt  |||  to resolve a 25 - year old conflict .
the party for a democratic society ( dtp ) was disbanded because it had become " a hotbed of damaging activities against the  |||  state  |||  's independence and its unfailing unity " , the president of the court , hasim kiliç , declared to the press at the end of four days of deliberations .
the decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges , while a majority of seven was sufficient to force the disbanding , mr. kiliç  |||  indicated  |||  , adding that 37 of the party 's representatives , including its president , ahmet türk , and the deputy , aysel tugluk , have been banished from political life for the next five years .
the judge also  |||  announced  |||  the lifting of the parliamentary immunity , from which both mr. türk and mrs. tugluk benefited , and the confiscation of party assets by the treasury .
the dtp occupies 21 seats in  |||  parliament  |||  ( out of 550 ) .
its leaders had warned prior to the verdict that the representatives would  |||  leave  |||  parliament rather than take their seats as representatives with no affiliation .
the decision was taken following proceedings launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the appeal court , abdurrahman yalçinkaya , who accuses the dtp of obeying " directives " from the kurdistan workers ' party ( pkk ) , which is  |||  considered  |||  to be a terrorist organisation by ankara and in many countries .
many observers believe the dtp serves as a legal  |||  political  |||  shop window for the pkk rebels .
the party maintains , however , that it has " no organic links " with the pkk , but refuses to recognise it as a terrorist organisation and is  |||  calling  |||  for the government to open negotiations with it .
the court 's verdict comes at a time when the government has extended its hand to the kurdish community by proposing a series of measures , reinforcing its rights in an  |||  attempt  |||  to quash kurdish support for the pkk and put an end to the conflict .
dtp leaders had stated that a dissolution of the party could lead to renewed tensions in the anatolian southeast , where a great number of protests against the  |||  terms  |||  for the detention of the pkk 's head , abdullah öcalan , have degenerated into clashes with police in the last few weeks .
as soon as the law made its announcement , a thousand protesters gathered  |||  before  |||  the dtp 's buildings in diyarbakir , the southeast 's main city , populated mainly by kurds .
police forces fired tear - gas grenades and used  |||  water  |||  cannons , as demonstrators threw molotov cocktails and stones with slings .
around a hundred people also  |||  demonstrated  |||  in istanbul .
following the verdict , mr. türk declared that the law 's decision would "  |||  deepen  |||  the despair " .
turkey cannot resolve this [  |||  kurdish  |||  ] issue by banning a party , he told the press .
the government , a party rooted in islamic influences , also  |||  condemned  |||  the decision .
we are opposed on  |||  principle  |||  to the closing down of parties .
it does not solve anything ,  |||  declared  |||  the energy minister , taner yildiz .
this decision puts a blowtorch to the government 's  |||  democratic  |||  olive branch , comments political analyst ahmet insel .
on thursday , the pkk claimed responsibility for an attack that  |||  killed  |||  seven soldiers in the north of turkey three days earlier , one of the bloodiest in the last few months .
a really hard , frosty  |||  winter  |||  , that is what wolfgang brauburger is wishing for .
not because he wants to make a laughing stock of people , says the the head of the fes  |||  winter  |||  road maintenance service .
this may be the case for the first time this  |||  weekend  |||  , according to meteorologists .
more than 330 employees and 120 vehicles are  |||  ready  |||  to take care of the snow and ice .
here , the fes is proceeding according to a  |||  precise  |||  plan .
these include , for instance ,  |||  main  |||  traffic roads and through roads , such as neue weg and hanauer landstrasse .
that is why the fes  |||  start  |||  at three in the morning , " so the routes are free by the time commuter traffic starts " .
it becomes  |||  difficult  |||  when it only begins snowing at 7.30 am.
then we are faced with a problem , says the  |||  head  |||  of the winter road service , " because nobody is prepared to make way for the gritting vehicles " .
only then , unless it continues to snow , is it the turn of approach and connecting roads , which also  |||  include  |||  rat - beil - strasse .
the last  |||  priority  |||  are quiet side and minor roads .
at five in the morning , the footmen of the fes set to work , and  |||  dangerous  |||  areas and passages are cleared .
the fes can  |||  usually  |||  not attend to all bike routes .
as slippery ice quickly  |||  forms  |||  on them , the gritter sets off as soon as temperatures drop below two degrees centigrade .
where  |||  required  |||  , it is also called out by the police .
tawa hallae looked like many other carnivorous dinosaurs : the animal , standing two metres tall and with a length of 1.50 metres on two strong hind legs , had a longish skull with sharp , curved teeth ,  |||  short  |||  arms with sickle - shaped claws and a long tail .
if the species had lived a couple of million years later , it would not be  |||  anything  |||  special .
but tawa hallae was one of the first dinosaurs with such physical features , reports sterling nesbitt and his colleagues at the  |||  university  |||  of texas in austin in science magazine of thursday .
the animal lived about 215 million years in what is today new mexico , which was back then in a dry  |||  zone  |||  of the super continent pangaea at the equator .
tawa opens a new window to the  |||  early  |||  evolution of dinosaurs , says nesbitt .
in 2006 nesbitt and the other palaeontologists  |||  started  |||  an excavation on the ghost ranch in northern new mexico .
" on some days we found dozen dinosaur bones , that is exemplary for sediments from the triassic period , " reports team member randall irmis of the utah museum of  |||  natural  |||  history .
the scientists  |||  identified  |||  some bones quickly .
find confirms theories on  |||  early  |||  dinosaur history
the name tawa  |||  comes  |||  from the sun god of the hopi indians .
for sterling nesbitt , it is an exceptional find : " dinosaur fossils from the triassic period are extremely rare . mostly , only  |||  individual  |||  fragments are found . "
" this find is not particularly spectacular , but it does confirm some theories on the  |||  early  |||  history of dinosaurs . " says martin sander of the university of bonn , for instance .
according to  |||  current  |||  doctrine , the dinosaurs appeared for the first time about 230 million years ago .
but many of the oldest fossils are incomplete , for which  |||  reason  |||  the classification of these primal dinosaurs is highly contentious .
according the  |||  analysis  |||  of nesbitt and his colleagues , tawa hallae is a primal theropod .
it has an interesting combination of primitive and progressive  |||  properties  |||  , says nesbitt .
on the skull of tawa hallae , for instance , the scientists found indications of air bags , as the  |||  descendants  |||  of the theropods , birds , have .
tawa hallae 's bones of the spine were  |||  obviously  |||  also partly filled with air .
tawa is the oldest and most primitive theropod with air bags ,  |||  says  |||  randall irmis .
at least three migration waves to north  |||  america  |||
as the most primitive dinosaurs  |||  known  |||  to date lived in south america , the scientists come to the conclusion that the saurians appeared there first .
the three cannot possibly descend from a  |||  common  |||  ancestor . so they must have migrated there , is the scientists argument .
we believe that there were at least three migration waves to north america , says alan turner of the  |||  american  |||  museum of natural history in new york , a co - author of the science study .
but there are of course  |||  contradictions  |||  .
an older species , silesaurus , which belongs to a sister group of the dinosaurs ,  |||  lived  |||  in what is today poland , says the bonn - based palaeontologist martin sander .
he believes that a distorted picture may emerge simply because a high  |||  number  |||  of primitive dinosaur fossils have survived over the years , while there is hardly anything to be found on other continents .
how dinosaurs managed to  |||  develop  |||  from a relatively rare sidearm of the reptile tree to become the ruling tetrapod vertebrate of the mesozoic , is still anybody 's guess .
during the triassic period , the dinosaurs still  |||  shared  |||  their habitat with a large amount of other reptiles , for instance with the ancestors of today 's crocodile and pterosaurs and with numerous other saurians .
towards the end of the triassic period , the dinosaurs spread across the globe and  |||  developed  |||  many new species , while their relatives died out on the threshold from the triassic to the jurassic periods .
|||  success  |||  story did not last for ever
there are two theories to explain this switch ,  |||  says  |||  martin sander .
there may have been a case of  |||  mass  |||  dying , which the dinosaurs randomly survived but not the other reptiles .
or the dinosaurs were better adjusted , meaning that they were able to beat off the  |||  competition  |||  .
150 million years later , a meteorite impact helped a group of animals , which had also  |||  developed  |||  back in the triassic period and since lived in the shadows to blossom : the mammals .
solidarity from  |||  vienna  |||  to sao paulo
the list is  |||  long  |||  and the signatories international .
professors of toronto  |||  university  |||  are on it , as are those from the university of cambridge , the university of vienna and berkeley in california .
lecturers from naples are included , from quebec , edinburgh , new york , sao paulo ,  |||  berlin  |||  or bremen .
the vacation by the police of the casino of the frankfurt goethe  |||  university  |||  is having repercussions throughout the world .
278 professors and teaching assistants of the goethe  |||  university  |||  , but also of colleges from all over germany , europe and north and south america are showing their solidarity with the protesting students on the westend campus .
in a statement written in both  |||  german  |||  and english , they " condemn " the police action initiated by the executive committee .
university president werner müller - estler had the  |||  building  |||  seized by students and assistant professors on strike last week , because walls and objects of art had been besmirched .
the exclusive  |||  focus  |||  on vandalism serves " to deligitimise and criminalise the protest " and distracts from the matter .
the executive committee has refused to enter into the  |||  necessary  |||  discourse .
the majority of the occupiers did not support the  |||  damage  |||  to property , read the statement .
|||  protest  |||  legitimised
the youth ranks of the verdi union and the  |||  german  |||  association of unions are also showing their solidarity with the students .
the protest is a legitimate expression of a growing  |||  concern  |||  for their own future , says verdi state youth secretary alexander klein .
hesse 's  |||  science  |||  minister eva kühne - hörmann ( cdu ) , however , supported the approach of the university president and police .
destruction and occupation are absolutely inacceptable  |||  means  |||  , the said in a topical session on thursday in the wiesbaden parliament .
a new silicon  |||  valley  |||
for many years , it was a secret city ,  |||  inaccessible  |||  to westerners .
zelenograd , one of ten districts in the capital moscow , was a highly guarded  |||  location  |||  for secret arms research during the soviet union .
nowadays , the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from  |||  moscow  |||  centre is regarded as russia 's silicon valley .
there were several visits , and on wednesday zelenograd and riedberg finally  |||  signed  |||  a " protocol for closer cooperation " in frankfurt on wednesday .
the moscow deputy mayor , yuri roslyak , and prefect anatoly smirnov of zelenograd led the russian delegation and economic affairs  |||  head  |||  edwin schwarz signed on behalf of frankfurt .
scientific  |||  exchange  |||
the idea is to establish continuous scientific  |||  exchange  |||  .
in turn ,  |||  russian  |||  businesses want to win orders in germany .
zelenograd is the headquarters to the most important  |||  russian  |||  research institutes and companies .
these include , for instance , the moscow institute of electrophysics , and  |||  major  |||  companies such as sitronics and rossiyskaya elektronika .
the municipality was founded in 1958 as a so - called " socialist  |||  planned  |||  city " for arms research .
the impact and  |||  dimensions  |||  of stuttgart 21 cannot be overestimated .
for its  |||  supporters  |||  , the project deals no less than with the " new heart of europe " .
quite rightly so . s 21 is far more than lowering a railway station , more than a gigantic construction project , which will plunge the city of the baden - württemberg state capital into a terrible chaos of  |||  building  |||  sites for a decade .
and therefore , terminus stations were supposed to disappear : as in frankfurt and  |||  munich  |||  .
and in stuttgart : a non - terminus station , which is approximately half way along the trans - european rail line between paris and budapest / bratislava -  |||  hence  |||  the slogan of the " heart of europe " .
s 21 is actually being built now , although the vision of the 1980s has no longer been compatible with the  |||  reality  |||  for years .
terminus stations also no longer have pulling in and out problems  |||  since  |||  the development of push - pull trains with railway traction units and control cabs at either end .
state and municipal  |||  politicians  |||  have enforced it .
an  |||  urban  |||  area is being created which , if the planners ' computer - generated graphics are to be believed , will feature a lot of green .
for the rail traffic system , s 21 is  |||  damaging  |||  .
the non - terminus railway station and the line extension are  |||  designed  |||  for passenger transportation , which - typical for the 1980s - is estimated to see huge growth .
at the time , there was no  |||  competition  |||  from no - frills airlines .
contemporary traffic policy , however , should be prioritising the handling of freight transportation , as transport by rail far more environmentally friendly than by lorry on the  |||  road  |||  .
a good six  |||  billion  |||  euros are to be buried in the swabian land .
that is the official  |||  figure  |||  .
experts expect ten to fifteen billion to be more  |||  realistic  |||  .
a total of sixty  |||  major  |||  projects are on the list of the transport ministry .
the rhine valley line will become a bottleneck for international freight transportation :  |||  right  |||  in the heart of europe .
|||  government  |||  reviewing verdict on airport
the state government did not decide in parliament whether it would appeal against the verdict of hesse 's administrative  |||  court  |||  ( vgh ) to ban night flights .
the vgh in kassel recently confirmed in writing that the state would have to reorganise the ban on night flights in the event of building the  |||  planned  |||  northwest runway at frankfurt airport .
the opposition criticised this  |||  delay  |||  and called upon the government representatives to do without an appeal before the federal administrative court in leipzig .
it is bloody difficult when you are allowed to  |||  keep  |||  one 's word , said greens leader tarek al-wazir , alluding to the fdp election slogan " we keep our word " .
minister posch  |||  rejected  |||  the accusation from schäfer - gümbel that the state government was trying to achieve their night flights by " skewing justice and playing tricks " .
a detailed  |||  legal  |||  examination would take time .
the coalition does not want to  |||  operate  |||  on the basis of " a brief first impression " .
we need a legally compliant  |||  decision  |||  , said stefan müller ( fdp ) .
as presented by the  |||  opposition  |||  , his party never made any statements regarding the ban on night flights .
us banks repay state  |||  support  |||
and , according to reports from us broadcaster cnbc , citigroup is also planning to repay the  |||  state  |||  support .
the institutions thereby want to wiggle themselves free from the restrictions going hand - in - hand with the acceptance of the money , such as the limits on manager bonuses and the paying of  |||  high  |||  charges .
bank of  |||  america  |||  had raised some usd 19 billion from investors through convertible loans .
the bank overstretched at the height of the financial crisis by taking over the  |||  investment  |||  bank merrill lynch .
citigroup also plans to raise cash on the capital market to  |||  free  |||  itself from its liabilities with the state .
already on thursday , the us bank was able to announce a capital  |||  increase  |||  of some usd 20 billion , reported cnbc with reference to circles .
a citigroup  |||  spokesman  |||  declined to comment .
goldman sachs , jp morgan chase and morgan stanley had already repaid their support in  |||  june  |||  .
a quick  |||  choice  |||
it all happened a lot faster than  |||  expected  |||  .
yesterday  |||  evening  |||  , the committee wanted to vote on the appointment .
the favourite was peter frey ,  |||  head  |||  of zdf 's main studio in berlin .
but zdf did not confirm this -  |||  officially  |||  , not to anticipate the process .
however , the plan not to further damage zdf director markus schächter , if this suggestion were also not successful with the  |||  board  |||  of directors , will also have played its part .
frey , schächter 's candidate , needs the  |||  support  |||  of nine of the 14 committee members .
the result of the vote was not  |||  known  |||  when going to press .
two weeks ago schächter had been unsuccessful at the board of directors with his suggestion to extend the agreement with nikolaus brender by  |||  another  |||  five years .
only seven members voted for brender , seven were against him . brender 's voting out was a severe blow to schächter , albeit one to be  |||  expected  |||  .
because the majority of the union in the administrative board had signaled already weeks  |||  before  |||  the vote that they would not confirm brender in office .
roland koch , the prime minister of hesse , had  |||  organised  |||  the opposition to the editor - in - chief .
with the argument that zdf 's news broadcasts had lost viewers under brender , he  |||  rejected  |||  a further term in office of the highly regarded editor - in - chief .
|||  until  |||  shortly before the election , there were therefore protests in which the exercising of political influence on the zdf was castigated .
|||  peter  |||  frey was born on 4 august 1957 in bingen .
he studied  |||  political  |||  and educational sciences and romance studies .
he later  |||  worked  |||  for the südwestfunk and the frankfurter rundschau .
in 1983 frey moved to the zdf ,  |||  initially  |||  to the heute - journal .
subsequent activities : from 1988 to 1990 personal officer of the editor - in - chief ; in 1991/92 correspondent in washington ; until 1998  |||  head  |||  and presenter of the morgenmagazin ; until 2001 head of zdf foreign affairs ; then head of the zdf head studio .
the greens  |||  announced  |||  after the voting out of brender , who was voted journalist of the year by the sector paper medium magazin only on wednesday , to press constitutional charges .
koch 's opponent on the board of directors , the rhineland - palatine prime minister kurt beck , explained last week that the states should amend the zdf treaty to the extend that  |||  staff  |||  suggestions of the director cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority .
however , beck too ruled out any removal of  |||  party  |||  politicians from the boards of directors of the zdf .
thanks to this proof of editorial independence , both schächter without losing  |||  face  |||  and the board of directors were able to vote for his appointment as editor - in - chief , without being suspected of promoting a partisan to this post .
in party calculations , frey is reckoned to be a left - leaning liberal  |||  anyway  |||  .
partial success for students : after a year of educational strikes , the culture ministers of the states finally came around on thursday : at a meeting of the culture minister and university principals conference , both parties agreed to  |||  improve  |||  the conditions of studying for bachelor and masters courses .
the students should , in the  |||  future  |||  , be in a position to master their studies .
in particular , they  |||  agreed  |||  to reduce the number of exams : every module shall , as a rule , be completed with one single exam .
in addition , the students ' workload shall be reviewed and " a  |||  realistic  |||  and acceptable extent " ensured .
the states undertake to organise more flexibly  |||  joint  |||  structural requirements for bachelor and masters courses .
|||  less  |||  exams
now it is being filled with  |||  specific  |||  contents for the first time .
the so - called accreditation council has decided to , in part , dramatically reduce the  |||  number  |||  of exams : " every module ends , as a rule , with an exam , " states the 30 - page paper , which is to newly govern the admission of courses in part .
in addition , " studiability " is to be the core criterion for the organisation in the  |||  future  |||  .
modules and contents " shall be strictly reviewed " as to whether " unnecessary constrictions on the students in their  |||  choice  |||  of
the students are " entitled to be granted leeway allowing and  |||  promoting  |||  initiative " .
the rules are to apply for the admission of new but also for the  |||  review  |||  of existing courses .
they need to be " reaccredited "  |||  every  |||  five years , which , however , means that it may take until 2015 until all courses have been reviewed .
ten accreditation  |||  agencies  |||  throughout germany oversee this , which report to the accreditation council set up by the states .
the culture ministers had " expressly " urged the states in october to influence the agencies in such a way that the number of subjects is not too  |||  large  |||  and the exams regime not too strict .
in some federal states , universities and colleges have already  |||  agreed  |||  on corresponding measures with the state ministries .
rhineland - palatine has  |||  promised  |||  additional funds for the further development of the bologna process ; so far , it is the only state to do so .
with this money , the colleges are , in particular , to set up tutor programmes and course consultations as well as strengthen exams and foreign  |||  offices  |||  .
the state and colleges plan to earmark 10 million  |||  euros  |||  for this .
in  |||  early  |||  2010 the government wants to bring an amendment to the universities act before parliament .
the course design is to  |||  become  |||  more flexible , while the recognition of past academic records at other universities is to become easier along with access to masters courses .
by the end of the  |||  coming  |||  year , all courses of the state are to be examined for their studiability .
the government and  |||  opposition  |||  had again argued over the study requirements in the state on thursday .
on top of  |||  praise  |||  , there was also criticism for the decisions .
the federal board of the young socialist  |||  university  |||  groups demanded the design of education policy should no longer take place " behind the closed doors " of ministers and university principals .
after the educational strike , at the latest , students should now also " have their say " as those  |||  affected  |||  .
the future academics  |||  received  |||  support from the president of the conference of university principals ( hrk ) , margret wintermantel : " we need the experiences of the students , " she said on thursday at a meeting with the culture ministers , with whom the hrk was debating a joint reform paper .
the education and science union ( gew ) deemed the bonn decisions to be not radical enough : it is  |||  demanding  |||  a legal claim , which would allow every graduate with a bachelor degree admission on a further masters course .
on the other hand , the states must ensure that for the  |||  current  |||  generation of bachelor students there are sufficient places on master courses with best - possible studying conditions , says gew executive board member andreas keller .
the culture ministers did , however , not issue a statement regarding  |||  free  |||  admission to masters courses .
going in and out of germany is nice , virtually no checks ... " is the first line of a poem by the poet werner söllner , in which he describes in disturbing fragments a dissident 's experience of arrival , who had gained freedom but simultaneously lost his  |||  language  |||  area .
werner söllner ,  |||  born  |||  in romania 's banat in 1951 , initially worked as a german and english teacher in bucharest and later as an editor in a children 's publishing house , before he moved to frankfurt am main in 1982 .
söllner has won several literature awards , in 1993 he was awarded the legendary frankfurt poetry readings at the goethe university , and since 2002 he has been  |||  head  |||  of the hesse literature forum in the mouson tower in frankfurt .
he caused a  |||  major  |||  extra - literary stir last tuesday during a conference in munich , debating " german literature in romania in the reflection and distortion of its securitate files " .
clearly unsettled and embarrassed , söllner read out a statement , in which he admitted before romano -  |||  german  |||  writer colleagues , i.e. richard wagner , william totok , franz hodjak and helmuth frauendorfer , his participation as an im for the romanian secret service , securitate .
jointly with some of those  |||  present  |||  , söllner 1989 had received the german language award in 1989 .
the recruitment attempts  |||  started  |||  gradually , first in 1971 .
i am , söllner concluded , " therefore someone , who did not put up  |||  enough  |||  resistance to the intimidation attempts of the securitate . "
the lyricist  |||  werner  |||  söllner is im walter .
virtually at the same time as the awarding of the nobel prize for herta müller and her unmatched literary discussion of the mechanisms of dictatorships , the literary scene and , in particular , the community of german authors with romanian roots is being shocked by a case which reveals the dark spots and perfidy of a political system  |||  based  |||  on control and spying .
werner söllner is , inasmuch as can be said on the basis of the current  |||  knowledge  |||  , not only a perpetrator , but also a victim .
in his securitate file , im walter played a part , said after söllner 's confession the literary scholar michael markel and referred to the  |||  positive  |||  influence im walter had for him .
he " boxed him out " in all  |||  points  |||  which were dangerous for him at the time , said markel .
söllner 's statement was in this  |||  form  |||  unexpected before this audience , although the confession of a former dissident and his collaboration with the romanian secret service is not entirely surprising .
germany was a cosy habitat for the security spies , as herta müller had already  |||  written  |||  in july in the zeit newspaper after reading her own file , 914 pages .
those affected , one can assume , will have guessed and in some cases even  |||  known  |||  whose real name was behind the code names of sorin , voicu and , of course , walter .
a national council to process securitate files ( snsas ) , which is comparable to the birthler  |||  authority  |||  , was only set up in 1999 , but the release of the files has been very slow .
a law regulating the  |||  administration  |||  of the files has only existed since 2005 .
they is psychotic , she was , after all , questioned more than  |||  once  |||  .
regarding the genesis of herta müller 's oeuvre , who yesterday  |||  received  |||  the nobel prize , it is more than a footnote .
it seemed as if a well - dressed field sales representative was just  |||  coming  |||  from a very nice christmas party , where a sports items manufacturer had handed out goodies , when the new vfb coach christian gross in the company of an orange plastic bag from the supplier got in a called out mercedes c class at a quarter past midnight . ̈
the man with the striking bald head was still needing a chauffeur , as the  |||  town  |||  was still unknown to him .
otherwise he could have driven  |||  himself  |||  - after all , no alcohol was involved and the 55 - year - old was not drunk .
a nice evening , but tomorrow the work would  |||  continue  |||  .
in the words of the swiss national , who had only just been employed three days before : " we may have  |||  reached  |||  the last sixteen , " i.e. in the champions league thanks to a 3:1 win over unirea urziceni from romania , " but we must n't be blinded by the success : we are in for a brutal fight against relegation . "
the " far more  |||  important  |||  task " is scheduled for sunday .
the champions league performance will have to be  |||  repeated  |||  in the day - to - day job of the league .
and the again revealed weaknesses after the three  |||  quick  |||  goals by marica ( 5. ) , träsch ( 8. ) and pogrebnyak ( 11. ) will have to be stopped .
the joy over the excellent start of the babbel successor  |||  therefore  |||  remained mute .
not only with the apparent saviour , who had given the unsettled stuttgart professionals self - confidence , commitment and joy in playing in a  |||  short  |||  period of time .
" i addressed the players and told them that they must consider their strengths , and urged them to be more courageous , " explained shrink gross his so simple - sounding recipe for success , which no longer had any  |||  effect  |||  under therapist babbel .
that is what we need in the current  |||  situation  |||  . "
under babel this was  |||  clearly  |||  lacking .
vfb stuttgart is still not out of the woods , warns  |||  sports  |||  director horst heldt
but vfb stuttgart  |||  needs  |||  , more than anything , consistency .
like gross , players and managers were eager not to overestimate the win over the depleted and hopelessly overburdened defence of the  |||  romanian  |||  guests .
they had also won in glasgow  |||  before  |||  the horribly awakening three days later in leverkusen in the 0:4 , warned khedira .
and sports director horst heldt pointed out that one aim of the season had been  |||  achieved  |||  , but that the other one was still a long way off .
the fact that heldt was not in any mood to celebrate on his 40th birthday and even on the first  |||  home  |||  win for three months , had to do with the events of the weekend , which were revived in the form of a tv interview with goalkeeper jens lehmann , which was screened immediately before the match .
there are decisions which other people take and not jens , was heldt 's response to lehmann 's  |||  harsh  |||  criticism .
the fact that his day off after matches had been cancelled , was also rated by lehmann as a sign of a  |||  lack  |||  of authority and resentment .
lehmann 's statements were " guided by pure egoism " , replied heldt and  |||  announced  |||  consequences for the keeper .
but , after all , they agreed with everybody else that without the work done by the replaced team of coaches , the  |||  strong  |||  performance , both in terms of play and spirit , would not have been possible .
babel and seine assistants had " a great share in the success " , said heldt and lehmann unanimously - and the man with the plastic bag also  |||  agreed  |||  .
but after twelve  |||  hard  |||  rounds , the ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the wbc .
hamburg - vitali klitchko remains heavyweight boxing  |||  world  |||  champion .
on saturday night in berne the 38 - year - old champion ( the wbc association version , ) beat the  |||  american  |||  kevin johnson unanimously by points ( 120:108 , 120:108 , 119:109 ) .
for klitchko this was his third successful  |||  defence  |||  of his title since his comeback in october 2008 .
before , the ukrainian had already twice been  |||  world  |||  champion of the wbo and wbc associations .
unfortunately , the knock - out , which everybody had  |||  expected  |||  , did not materialise .
klitchko extended his  |||  record  |||  to 39 wins in 41 professional matches , twice he had to give in due to injury .
nevertheless , he is only the second boxed since timo hoffmann in 2000 who fight the  |||  full  |||  twelve rounds against klitchko .
the challenger had caused quite a stir in the  |||  swiss  |||  capital before the fight .
he insulted klitchko as " an ugly zombie " , who " cannot do  |||  anything  |||  at all " .
during weighing , the champion then  |||  allowed  |||  himself to be provoked to knock johnson 's sunglasses of his nose " to be able to see into his eyes . "
|||  fourth  |||  victory after klitchko 's return
klitchko came out on top in his  |||  fourth  |||  fight since his comeback on 11 october 2008 .
after a sabbatical nearly four years , he beat the nigerian samuel peter in berlin and regained " his " wbc belt , which he had been forced to hand over  |||  before  |||  without a fight .
his dream , however , remains the unification of all  |||  important  |||  titles in his family .
but the wba belt is worn by britan  |||  david  |||  haye after he dethroned the 2.13 - metre tall nikolay valuev in november .
spd and  |||  left  |||  party demanding a clarification from the chancellor .
the minister apparently made " knowingly false statements " regarding the fatal bombing of two tank trailers in september , said green party  |||  head  |||  jürgen trittin on saturday in the ard news programme tagesschau .
that is the substance of the report , which nato had , which mr. guttenberg has  |||  read  |||  , said trittin .
on friday it was revealed that the attack was not only about destroying the abducted tankers , but also to specifically kill two taleban  |||  leaders  |||  .
the us air strike ordered by the  |||  german  |||  kunduz commander colonel klein , up to 142 people were killed of injured , according to the nato inquiry report .
the greens , spd and left party linke called on chancellor angela merkel ( cdu ) on saturday to address parliament immediately and to  |||  clarify  |||  what guttenberg really knew about the event .
merkel must clarify whether a strategy of  |||  targeted  |||  killing is part of the federal government 's afghanistan policy , and whether the chancellor 's office , german army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy , demanded jürgen trittin and his greens colleague renate künast .
|||  government  |||  spokesman ulrich wilhelm rejected the criticism resolutely .
on saturday , doubts over the presentation by the ministry of the background of the dismissal of inspector  |||  general  |||  wolfgang schneiderhan and state secretary peter wichert emerged .
officially , it was said that they had lied about the existence of the nato reports and kept sensitive  |||  details  |||  from the minister .
from the entourage of the top official , however , it was said that the  |||  defence  |||  ministry had even been directed to several reports , including a two - page documents of the commanding colonel klein and a report from the military police .
in the meantime , wichert is supposed to have asked for clarification in a  |||  letter  |||  , reports the frankfurter allgemeine sonntagszeitung .
|||  dream  |||  worlds
some see images and  |||  hear  |||  voices when they are awake which others do not hear or see .
as long as this happens in sleep , things are  |||  fine  |||  .
but anybody experiencing dream - like conditions or  |||  seeing  |||  and hearing things other people do not when they are awake , is regarded in contemporary western society as a madman or drug addict , or strange at the very least .
but such  |||  images  |||  and voices are formed not only in the mentally sick or during drug intoxication .
this is down to our imagination : the same neural processes which allow us to design houses , draw paintings or write novels can make the borders between dream , madness and  |||  reality  |||  become blurred .
conscious conditions which are warped like dreams can occur in the most different  |||  forms  |||  , in the best case we call them visions , in the worst case madness .
even if their triggers and  |||  effects  |||  may differ , the visions of mystic hildegard von bingen , the drug experiences of new age prophet carlos castaneda , shaman detachment from reality conditions , psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes .
hallucination or delusions occur when the balance of the neural transmitters of the brain - predominantly dopamine noradrenaline , serotonin and acetylcholine - derails and the interaction of  |||  different  |||  brain segments is dysfunctional .
|||  complex  |||  hallucinations and delusional thoughts often occur during schizophrenic psychoses .
gravity no longer has any  |||  power  |||  over him
aristotle  |||  understood  |||  hallucinations to be a form of dream while awake , wilhelm griesinger , a founder of modern psychiatry , detected in 1861 a " huge similarity of madness and dreamlike conditions " , for sigmund freud dreams were even " a psychosis , with all puzzles , delusions and misperceptions of such " .
it is autumn 2001 when henning t. turns into a comic  |||  figure  |||  .
his  |||  body  |||  is two - dimensional and excessively gaudy .
gravity no longer has any  |||  power  |||  over him , he floats at the ceiling of the room .
behind him are winged devilish  |||  figures  |||  with red , distorted faces , snarling .
they hunt him , kick him with  |||  heavy  |||  , flaming boots , throw him against walls , he feels the pain all over his body .
loud , evil voices emerge from the walls and  |||  radio  |||  .
he climbs on a speaker and puts the noose  |||  around  |||  his neck .
let that be a lesson to you , the voices scream in an eardrum - tearing choir , " go to the clinic and get  |||  treated  |||  ! "
today , henning t. is 40 years old , he has had six acute psychoses , the  |||  last  |||  one is two years back , the first nearly 20 years ago .
his  |||  diagnosis  |||  is a schizoaffective - paranoid psychosis , he is also a manic - depressive , he takes drugs against depression , the mania and schizophrenia .
he has learned to live with his  |||  illness  |||  , he has been married for three years .
in psychosis i  |||  experienced  |||  the worst fear and deepest desperation , he says .
the illusions are a brutal  |||  reality  |||
in an acute schizophrenic psychosis , people affected can no longer distinguish between internal and external  |||  world  |||  , they reach an overexcited condition which can result in hallucinations , megalomania , paranoia or persecution mania .
|||  particularly  |||  common is the hearing of voices - voices which command , comment or involve in dialogue .
the affected person can no longer distinguish important things from unimportant things , the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals , the  |||  conscious  |||  is flooded by impressions .
like dreams , a psychosis also opens the floodgates on a  |||  flood  |||  of ideas and phantasies , which stem from the deeper levels of the conscious .
the perception of reality in a psychosis is subject - centred , says professor thomas fuchs , senior physician at the clinic for  |||  general  |||  psychiatry at the university clinic of heidelberg .
schizophrenic patients are at the  |||  heart  |||  of the events , the meaning of everything is directed to him .
at the same time , he finds himself in a passive  |||  role  |||  , he is , like in a dream , overwhelmed by the events can cannot affect them actively .
schizophrenic patients therefore often  |||  feel  |||  threatened , controlled and manipulated .
a  |||  reality  |||  comparison is often not available to them , the illusions are a brutal reality , waking up is not possible .
to experience a hallucination  |||  once  |||  in your life
the delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based in  |||  reality  |||  , the distortion of the events takes place within a framework of reality .
precisely why our  |||  brain  |||  plays such tricks on us , is still puzzling to scientists .
but not everybody will  |||  develop  |||  a psychosis .
there seems to be a genetic tendency to schizophrenia , but studies of twins have shown that genes are not the  |||  sole  |||  factor .
we think that the neuronal maturing of the brain is disturbed in an early  |||  stage  |||  of development , through a virus infection in the mother during pregnancy , for instance , explains fuchs .
but it remains a mystery how disturbances to the neuronal system  |||  comes  |||  about which also do not become manifest for many years initially .
hallucinogen  |||  drugs  |||  can trigger psychoses , as they interfere with the transmitter system .
kasten has been collecting reports for ten years on hallucinations and delusions ; last year he assessed his results in a book titled the unreal world in our  |||  head  |||  .
hallucinations are a typical by - product of psychoses , but also of a remarkably large amount of other  |||  diseases  |||  .
these include , on top of mental illnesses such as borderline or depression , also often  |||  diseases  |||  such as migraine , epilepsy , multiple sclerosis or alzheimer 's disease and traumatic brain injuries .
surprisingly , even the brain of healthy people hallucinates under  |||  certain  |||  conditions .
drugs can trigger this condition as much as brain  |||  damage  |||  or a psychosis .
but sensory deprivation , stress , lovesickness or other mental  |||  exceptional  |||  conditions too .
in more recent studies , up to one third of respondents claimed to have experienced a hallucination at least  |||  once  |||  in their lives .
in summer 2005 sarah k. is 16 years old , she is  |||  living  |||  in a small town in mecklenburg - vorpommern and goes to the local secondary school .
indeed , a perfectly  |||  normal  |||  girl .
it it were not for the images and  |||  voices  |||  .
during breaks , it can happen that a lanky boy with  |||  long  |||  dark hair approaches her .
when she answers him , her schoolmates look at her in  |||  surprise  |||  - nobody else sees or hears this boy .
she is awake , she  |||  sees  |||  and hears this boy , just like she sees and hears the girl at the desk next to her .
she can even feel his  |||  presence  |||  , at least for some moments .
a  |||  pleasant  |||  feeling it is , she likes the boy .
but she knows that this boy and the other illusions are not  |||  real  |||  and disappear again .
when she is sitting in the classroom , she sometimes cannot  |||  follow  |||  because the teacher is to her eyes and ears just introducing a new schoolmate , while she is explaining mathematical equations on the blackboard for everyone else .
at  |||  night  |||  the appearances are usually frightening .
let me be , she screams at the  |||  figures  |||  .
she does not tell her parents or friends  |||  anything  |||  about this , they would think she was mad .
|||  autumn  |||  2009 . sarah k. is 20 years old now .
she passed her a levels last year and is now  |||  living  |||  with her boyfriend .
|||  since  |||  she contacted psychologist kasten via the internet , she knows exactly that she is not mad .
if someone is socially  |||  isolated  |||  or suffers from sensory deprivation , he will very probably suffer from hallucinations after some time , says kasten .
i assume that the brain is not busy  |||  enough  |||  and creates its own entertainment .
sarah k. , a single child , was afraid of other children when she was small ; she often played  |||  alone  |||  .
her hallucinations  |||  started  |||  when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she called dad since she could think was not her natural father .
as during visual and acoustic hallucinations those areas of the brain become active which also process real impressions and sounds , it is often  |||  difficult  |||  for patients like sarah k. to distinguish between illusions and reality . " every experience , " says kasten , " takes place in the brain , reality is reproduced there .
hallucinations are also images , which the brain creates , this is why they seem so  |||  real  |||  . "
the hallucinations of the healthy are not  |||  fundamentally  |||  different from those during an acute psychosis .
contrary to schizophrene patients , mentally healthy people are able to  |||  identify  |||  illusions as unreal .
kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate hallucinations as a  |||  special  |||  ability .
|||  border  |||  between dream and hallucination
in our far too conscious - centred  |||  world  |||  , imaginary experiencing is often unfortunately pathologised , says michael schmidt - degenhard , professor in heidelberg and senior physician of the clinic for psychiatry and psychotherapy of the florence nightingale hospital in düsseldorf .
a psychosis is a severe , painful  |||  illness  |||  , but it also brings positive aspects , creativity - madness is also a work of art born out of desperation .
schmidt - degenhard has researched the so - called oneiroid experience , a  |||  particular  |||  form of conscious conditions which are warped like dreams .
oneiroids are highly complex , detailed quasi dreams , which the person experiencing them believes are  |||  real  |||  and which he later cannot distinguish from being awake .
the oneiroid condition occurs in trauma - or sickness - related extreme situations , for instance in polyradiculitis patients , who experience a motor paralysis in  |||  full  |||  consciousness .
if a person is threatened by self - or world loss , for instance due to persistent , complete loss of mobility , he replaces the life - threatening  |||  real  |||  situation with an own , imaginary world , which is uncoupled from reality , says schmidt - degenhard .
a kind of  |||  border  |||  between dream and hallucination
as the mastering of a situation is not possible in reality , a change of world takes place , but the  |||  real  |||  situation is not updated in the imagination .
everything is  |||  real  |||  , even later in the memory
the zurich - based art historian peter cornelius claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book a change of  |||  heart  |||  as the sole 's attempt to safe itself .
he is 49 years old when his consciousness takes off on journeys for days after heart valve surgery with  |||  subsequent  |||  heart transplantation while his body is damned to immobility in the intensive care unit .
claussen delves into a world of his creation , visits foreign places and  |||  times  |||  : he experiences himself as a bedridden , old man , on board a train sanatorium , a robot watching over his health .
he lives in the early  |||  middle  |||  ages amongst noblemen who make intoxicants from blood .
he is fully taken up with the imaginary events ; everything is  |||  real  |||  , even later in his memory .
dream is a  |||  different  |||  condition , he describes his experience .
even clearer and more  |||  intense  |||  that real events .
the intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our day - to - day experiences ,  |||  says  |||  psychiatrist schmidt - degenhard .
ultimately , oneiroids , psychoses , hallucinations and drug intoxication  |||  show  |||  how fragile our images of the external reality are , even when awake .
every change to the conscious , summarises psychologist kasten , " can  |||  result  |||  in a warping of what we call reality " .
kallen , the new head of the publishing house , is an interim solution : in the  |||  long term  |||  , hubert burda wants his company to be taken over by his two children , he has told the spiegel magazine .
hamburg - the publisher hubert burda sees the  |||  long  |||  - term future of his company in his children 's hands .
the question whether they will be active in the  |||  company  |||  will only arise later .
also the question  |||  whether  |||  they are able to do so .
one cannot put one 's children in charge of 7,500 employees if they are not  |||  capable  |||  of this .
on thursday , burda announced that he would be resigning from his post as chairman as of january and  |||  appointed  |||  paul - bernhard kallen as his successor .
52 - year - old kallen has been a  |||  member  |||  of the board at burda since 1999 .
he was initially responsible for  |||  technology  |||  .
later , with the treasury department , he assumed responsibility for the company assets , and after jürgen todenhöfer 's departure , also for  |||  direct  |||  marketing , foreign operations , print and finances .
burda 's children are 19 and 17 ; his son felix , who would be 42 today ,  |||  died  |||  a couple of years ago .
that never was my  |||  strategy  |||  .
he never had " dreams of world  |||  power  |||  " , says burda .

in short , it hopes to  |||  promote  |||  what will be the transportation of the future .
3 '  |||  electric  |||  cities '
but barcelona is not the only city that is going to be involved in the  |||  implementation  |||  of the electric car in spain .
madrid and seville are joining the  |||  project  |||  .
the electric company endesa has already  |||  signed  |||  a framework agreement with the generalitat of catalonia .
with that , it hopes to  |||  promote  |||  the activities of the research and technological development in the autonomous community of catalonia .
these  |||  include  |||  activities linked to energy and , in particular , energy efficiency .
it is not the only  |||  initiative  |||  endesa is involved in regarding the promotion of the electric vehicle .
the company participates in standardization groups at the  |||  european  |||  level and has a series of active complementary projects , such as g 4v , elvire and cenit verde .
zapatero sees ' a horizon of peace ' for the  |||  automotive sector  |||  .
the  |||  prime minister  |||  , jose luis rodriguez zapatero , catches a glimpse of ' a horizon of peace ' for the spanish automotive industry , which , he pointed out , is the principal export sector in the country .
" without the automotive competitiveness plan , today we would have a panorama of neglect and the closure of some of our  |||  major  |||  production plants , " the prime minister explained .
" through this plan and the arrangement of the brands to continue in this highly  |||  competitive  |||  sector in spain , we can have a horizon of peace for the future of this industry , which is our principal export sector , " he added .
zapatero also stressed the government 's measures to support the demand , alluding to plan 2000e ,  |||  implemented  |||  in collaboration with the autonomous communities and automotive brand .
according to the prime minister , this plan has reduced emissions by 6 % in new vehicles  |||  sold  |||  on the spanish market and has brought about a " sharp increase " in enrollment , which rose by " 40 percent " in november ..

mazda3 i -  |||  stop  |||  : sustainable sportsmanship
mazda wants to  |||  show  |||  that sportsmanship is not incompatible with the environment .
therefore , mazda3 has just added an engine stopping and starting system - dubbed as the i -  |||  stop  |||  - , a mechanism which is , for the moment at least , only available with the 150 - horse power 2.0 petrol engine .
this  |||  second  |||  generation of the mazda3 stands out for its overall high ratings .
the finishes , features , comfort , performance , mechanics , the i -  |||  stop  |||  system ...
starting with the driver 's  |||  seat  |||  , we see that the front seats offer excellent ergonomics and support .
this style reminds us , in  |||  part  |||  , of the honda civic .
so , we can say that the mazda3 and the civic , both  |||  japanese  |||  , contrast with the sobriety of the german products , more specifically , the volkswagen golf , which everyone wants to beat .
continuing with the interior , this  |||  japanese  |||  compact is easily roomy enough for four adults to travel in great comfort .
this engine is a real delight . what makes it outstanding are its subtlety ,  |||  reduced  |||  noise levels , features and fuel consumption .
and even though the diesel versions of the madzda3 will be in higher demand , those who do n't do too much mileage a year should not dismiss this i -  |||  stop  |||  petrol engine system , both for its elevated driving comfort and its fuel consumption .
the standard equipment is excellent , especially the lane changing assistant ( rvm ) which eliminates the blind spot , the traction and stability controls , the speed control , the interior photosensitive mirror , the  |||  large  |||  - screen onboard computer , the parking sensors , independent climate control , rain and lights sensor , bluetooth and bluetooth audio , and 17 " alloy wheels .
additionally , with less equipment , this version comes with the premium pack , which , for 1,500 euros , also features : bi - xenon adaptive headlights and a bose  |||  sound  |||  system with cd changer , among other things .
|||  conclusion  |||
the mazda3 2.0 i -  |||  stop  |||  is one of the best compacts in its category .
it is particularly outstanding in terms of the quality of the materials used , its performance , and the high  |||  standard  |||  of its equipment .
additionally , those who do less yearly mileage can opt for this version of the i -  |||  stop  |||  , associated only with the 150 - horse - power 2.0 engine .
the only drawback of this model is its  |||  high  |||  price , which ranges from 21,770 euros for the luxury pack to 23,270 euros for the sportive version , tested here .
in exchange for the high price , the mazda3 will  |||  offer  |||  a large daily dose of satisfaction .

the  |||  promise  |||  of fonpeek
seeing it on the street is more difficult , to be honest , but the  |||  idea  |||  can be interesting , especially for children .
given its success , the company has released two new devices : one exclusively for twitter , the other with a  |||  free  |||  data service for life in exchange for paying six times more for the peek .
fonpeek ,  |||  presented  |||  at the la web event yesterday , is the european version of the invention and its third incarnation .
the monthly service price , around 12 euros a month , includes roaming  |||  throughout  |||  europe .
the  |||  idea  |||  of fixed - price roaming is incredibly attractive and long awaited .
there 's a fear of  |||  using  |||  data outside one 's home country , and rightly so .
for a gadget like the fonpeek ( it no longer seems strange that it is called fon since it lacks wifi ) to get this kind of fee , it means that the operators are starting the think differently and study  |||  different  |||  means of recouping the cost of their data networks .
the kindle is  |||  another  |||  good example , including a book downloading feature and other internet queries .
no  |||  contracts  |||  , no bother .
it 's a  |||  connected  |||  device and is paid for when it 's purchased , not month by month .
and that is what i  |||  hope  |||  to see one day with fonpeek , a call option with life - time access , which the peek already has in the u.s.
i  |||  hope  |||  so because i think it 's an unfair model for the consumer .
it would be  |||  interesting  |||  to see a computer with the same system .
michelle 's  |||  color  |||  fetish
yellow is , without a  |||  doubt  |||  , the u.s. first lady 's favorite color .
she already attended barak obama 's inauguration as u.s. president in a yellow dress and coat ; she chose the same to accompany him to what was undoubtedly the second most important  |||  moment  |||  of his life : the nobel peace prize ceremony in oslo .
michelle obama wore a very  |||  similar  |||  dress on both occasions:apart from being a similar yellow - green color with bright highlights - , both times the outfit consisted of three pieces , a dress , jacket and coat of the same material , and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace .
but the material the two suits are made of make them very  |||  different  |||  .
if the inauguration was about thick lace , in  |||  oslo  |||  it was patterned velvet .
the accessories have also varied :  |||  green  |||  medium - heeled shoes the other time , and now a similar design , but in gold .
and equally  |||  different  |||  is the hair style : on this occasion , hair tied back ; previously she wore her hair down .
75 % of  |||  working  |||  mothers have had work problems during maternity .
discrimination at work has  |||  increased  |||  in recent years , especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers .
this has been revealed by a study entitled '  |||  fertility  |||  and work history of women in spain ' , developed by the csic in collaboration with the women 's institute .
the survey of 9,737 women from 15 to 75 years old leaves no doubt about it : 75 % of  |||  working  |||  mothers have seen their opportunities in the workplace limited due to maternity .
the study notes that there are many differences in when couples  |||  start  |||  cohabiting , in the number of children , depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they do .
those that do n't have an activity outside of the home , work part time , or do n't have a stable job  |||  start  |||  living with their partner sooner , expect their first child , and have more children .
by contrast , women with a stable job , especially in the  |||  public  |||  sector , put off cohabitation and motherhood and have fewer offspring .
additionally , the type of job held has a great influence over  |||  maternity  |||  , but less over the mating schedule , " explains csic researcher , margarita delgado .
level of education is  |||  another  |||  factor whichdifferentiates the age of women marrying and having their first child .
according to the survey , the higher the level of education , the older the age at which they get married and have their first  |||  child  |||  .
there was also a  |||  difference  |||  among women from the same generation .
for example , in a group of 35- to 49 - year - olds , those who had elementary and those who and higher  |||  education  |||  had become mothers for the first time , on average , at 25.1 and 32.1 respectively .
their level of education provides yet  |||  another  |||  division among women .
l'oréal paris has just added a new  |||  name  |||  to its enviable list of ambassadors : diane kruger .

the former model jerry hall'sdaughter , georgia may jagger , was  |||  chosen  |||  as model of the year .
|||  poker  |||  by manuel vicent
in ' four aces ' ( alfaguara , illustrations by fernando vicente ) manuel vicent gives us thirty profiles of writers who have passed through their literary  |||  life  |||  ( and , in some cases , the other one too ) .
he does not do it in  |||  predictable  |||  or terrible ways ( biographical sketch , life and work ) , rather by looking for something that sparked the creation of the character .
in addition to being an exquisite pleasure , the book is a touching invitation to be  |||  read  |||  and reread .
on graham greene : " our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years , in which flesh combined the excitement of adultery with the pleasure of remorse , a spiritual privilege which consisted of  |||  reaching  |||  heaven through the road of perdition . "
of himself , he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner in the  |||  county  |||  , and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile .
the husband  |||  accepted  |||  it as normal when she told him that edward vii spied on her from the azaleas and that the birds sang in greek .
there has never been a man so  |||  patient  |||  and in love with a neurotic woman whose literary talent came before her madness . "

|||  cowardly  |||  aggression
our indignation knew no bounds because we do n't see the fun in gratuitous aggression towards a  |||  small  |||  and defenseless animal , which by the way , was on a leash .
the incident took place on atuesday at five o'clock in the afternoon in what is usually a quiet  |||  neighborhood  |||  .
the outrage has led us to denounce this  |||  fact  |||  .
we do n't understand what is happening when young people consider it fun to gratuitously mistreat a defenseless animal which gives us  |||  love  |||  , companionship and friendship .
we do n't know if there is any politeness and respect for  |||  animals  |||  and people left .
this initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet , because it is the only means of protection capable of preventing  |||  head  |||  injuries and even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle .
this new campaign  |||  promoting  |||  helmet use in motorcycles , under the motto ' to be or not to be , ' will initially distribute posters to more than 500 motorcycle shops to spread the message as widely as possible .
|||  sales  |||  of light commercial vehicles on the increase
the 9,425 vehicles registered in november in spain represent a  |||  rise  |||  of 12.6 % from 2008 , and , more importantly , indicates the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline , according to figures from the manufacturers association ( anfac ) and the vendors association ( ganvam ) .
however , it 's not time to start celebrating since the reference the comparison was made to - november 2008- was particularly bad , with a 60 %  |||  decrease  |||  from the previous year .
the outcome is that , regardless of last month 's upturn , the  |||  total  |||  number of registrations during those 11 months is 40 % below last year 's .
as a result of the restrictions caused by closed tap bank loans , it is  |||  necessary  |||  to add other factors like increasing unemployment and the persistent economic decline .
in light of this , unlike cars , the aid of the 2000epurchase has done  |||  little  |||  .
the sellers ' association predicts that 2010 will be  |||  similar  |||  to the year coming to a close , which estimates a 19 % drop in sales ( passenger cars and 4x4s ) .
the measure , imposed by the european union , aims to increase pedestrian safety ; however , how they work can also help  |||  prevent  |||  many rear - end collisions .
what the emergency brake assistant does is  |||  increase  |||  the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency , which the system detects through the driver 's pressure on the pedal .
but this does n't always  |||  maintain  |||  that pressure through to the end .
according to a study  |||  conducted  |||  by the car components manufacturer , bosch , a third of drivers involved in an accident had not stepped on the brake before a collision and half of them did n't apply the full force .
up to 1,100  |||  accidents  |||
according to an eu study , if all  |||  cars  |||  were equipped with this feature , 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided a year .
in this case , the vehicle is equipped with a system which ( via radar or a camera ) detects obstacles and warns the  |||  driver  |||  , in addition to lightly applying the brakes .
if the driver reacts , he helps it by increasing the pressure on the pedal if it is  |||  necessary  |||  .
if he does not react , and even though the collision is unavoidable , the device exerts the maximum force to the brakes to minimize  |||  damage  |||  .
|||  general  |||  motors delays opel plan until january
while workers at the opel plant in figueruelas ( zaragoza ) have already been informed by nick reilly , the new president of  |||  general  |||  motors ( gm ) europe , that the production of the new meriva will begin in the first week of april - probably the 8th - as reported by javier ortega , the u.s. manufacturer is cautioning that more time is needed to conclude the recovery plan for opel .
nick reilly , the new president of gm europe , wants each of the points of the new plan to have the prior approval of the  |||  affected  |||  party .
and this may make the  |||  final  |||  document , which will be submitted first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories , be delayed until the beginning of 2010 .
it is not strange that the swedish government has  |||  increased  |||  the pressure on the u.s. manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible .
gm admits to having had contact with some  |||  potential  |||  new buyers .
one of them could be geely , which aims to acquire volvo , but the option of the  |||  dutch  |||  sports car manufacturer skyper , which is funded by the russian group converg , is gaining momentum .
in the event that none of them come to an agreement , gm would be able to sell some saab assets to the  |||  chinese  |||  baic .
the decision to  |||  close  |||  saab at the end of the year if it is not sold still stands .
|||  driving  |||  the porsche boxster spyder
to develop their latest and most precious gem , the porsche engineers took the boxster s as a  |||  base  |||  and succeeded in trimming it by no less than 80 kilos , making the total weight a mere 1,275 kilos .
this led them to , first , cutting out the automatic roof , which has been substituted by a manually - operated canvas one , saving 21 kilos ;  |||  using  |||  aluminum doors , like those on the gt 3 , ' dropping ' another 15 , removing the climate control , 13 ; reducing the gas tank from 64 to 54 liters , earning 7 more kilos ; mounting sporty bucket seats , another 12 , and with the 19 - inch lightweight wheels , five .
even though it is also  |||  available  |||  with the pdk dual - clutch shift , the test was conducted on a unit with the six - speed manual transmission , mainly on the back roads of california and along stretches of really windy mountain roads .
the reduction in  |||  weight  |||  does not imply that the car does n't grip the asphalt .
rather the complete opposite : it has been some time since we tested a model so small and  |||  light  |||  , which , in turn , transmitted so much confidence when cornering , even at high speeds .
just what we asked for . thanks to its steering , as communicative as it is  |||  precise  |||  , what we tell it with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do .
and it will do it with surgical  |||  precision  |||  .
the  |||  sound  |||  of its v 6 boxer with 320 horse power ( 10 more than the boxster s ) is well made and can be enhancedwith the ' sport ' option and through a system that modifies the roar of the engine , which debuted earlier in the panamera .
the acceleration is  |||  brutal  |||  , either from a standstill or recovering .
the suspension is  |||  firm  |||  but not harsh or uncomfortable .
the electronic aids  |||  hardly  |||  showed up on the course ; that is because , well into the morning , we found early morning ice and gravel on some curves .
the car will go on  |||  sale  |||  in february 2010 , priced at 70,931 euros .

baskonia gives away a victory in  |||  israel  |||
caja laboral achieved a stunning 82-91 victory on their visit to the maccabee electra court despite dusko ivanovic 's team 's heavy losses , and after the great  |||  performance  |||  by mizra teltovic , who was the best on his team with eight three - pointers scored ( 29 points ) , they now at the top of their group .
the vitorian team knew to make up for the  |||  significant  |||  absences of herrmann , oleson , huertas and micov with a big dose of involvement and team work , even though it had to hold out until the end to take the victory .
additionally , their huge success from the sidelines , with 16 three pointers scored , had a lot to do with the  |||  final  |||  triumph .
the game started out in favor of the azulgranas , who put themselves ahead on the scoreboard from the  |||  start  |||  .
as vitora 's first four baskets were from the perimeter , the speculation was already that they had jumped into the  |||  israeli  |||  net with hot wrists .
|||  english  |||  and teletovic were the main scorers of the 18-20 at the end of the first period .
but the game ,  |||  despite  |||  being headed for half time , was not more decidedand the maccabees tried to remind the vitorians that not just anybody wins on their court , and with the ' hand of elias ' putting the pressure on , they managed to get involved in the game .
ivanovic 's players , injured but far from dead ,  |||  needed  |||  to run a couple of plays correctly before they could breathe , and that 's when the machine gun marza teletovic arrived , with three almost consecutive three - pointers and the help of english and ribas , he brought the scoreboard back to a reassuring lead ( 54-67 ) , which the home team managed to narrow down at the end of the third quarter ( 57-67 ) .
the alavas worked themselves to the bone in the last period , and english and san emeterio ( 65-75 ) had already made it clear that they were not going to let  |||  anyone  |||  take away what they had earned during the first thirty minutes .
however , pnini and eidson , the best on their team , did not give up and tried to  |||  keep  |||  their team alive from the three - point line ( 70-77 ) .
in spite of this , and with splitter fouling out , ivonic 's team did n't rush ,  |||  defended  |||  well , and , even though the israelis came close at the last minute , the game ws already won and victory escaped tel aviv for the first time in the season .
injuries impede unicaja 's  |||  fight  |||
unicaja lost miserably in greece against the olympiacos and gave them the  |||  lead  |||  in group b of the euroleague in a game marked by the loss of the cajistas , especially in the inside game ( freeland , lima and archibald ) which facilitated the greek victory .
the malaga team was not cowed by the atmosphere in the  |||  peace  |||  and friendship stadium , nor by the excellence of its rival , maybe the most powerful in europe and with a big budget .
the  |||  playing  |||  exhibited in the first quarter allowed the andalusians to take it easy . an aggressive defense and three consecutive three - pointers , two from the point guard omar cook , and one from guillem gubio , baffled the home team 12-18 , minute 9 .
the olympiacos were obviously surprised by unicaja 's intensity , even though the home team 's arsenal in the inside game with bourousis , vujcic and schortsanitis brought them back to 22-20 , in the 13th minute , at which  |||  point  |||  an attempted fight between the two u.s. point guards , beverley and williams , resulted in the disqualification of both players .
between them the inside players and the lithuanian forward , linas leizas , with their three - pointers ,  |||  increased  |||  the lead to 44-32 in the 19th minute .
the third period was very offensive for the olympiacos , who , despite 19 losses ,  |||  proved  |||  superior and began to even out the difference in the game in malaga , making it 66-48 in the 27th minute , which shook the group leader .
unicaja tried to overcome their absences and the  |||  latest  |||  withdrawal of the scottish center , robert archibald , who was injured during the game .
the  |||  croatian  |||  center , nikola vujcic , managed to bring back the basket average to 81-62 in the 37th minute and unicaja gave up , handing the top - seed over to the olympiacos .
facebook users can know the salary they deserve according to their profile , thanks to a new application trovit , the search engine with the largest  |||  number  |||  of real - estate , employment and car classifieds in spain .
the tool " how much should you charge ? " estimates wages of users from more than 140,000 employment offers in spain on trovit ,  |||  based  |||  on a form available on facebook , where you must enter your profession , years of experience , your age and the city where you want to work .
in the week that the application was launched , the search engine had detected that in  |||  general  |||  , the spanish worker " feels underpaid , " said the trovit product manager , albert ribera .
according to the data trovit uses from its search engines in the united kingdom and france , the spanish are the lowest  |||  paid  |||  .
a british programmer charges 45,226 euros gross per year , and a  |||  french  |||  one 31,059 , as opposed to the 24,000 a spaniard receives .
similarly , a  |||  driver  |||  receives an annual net pay of 34,247 euros in england , 25,751 in france , and 16,420 in spain .
according to trovit , the lowest  |||  paid  |||  job in spain is waiter , with annual net earnings of 11,592 euros ; followed by salesperson , with 14,725 euros , and operator , with 15,667 euros .
the most searched - for jobs on the net in the past three months are drivers , part - time jobs and social  |||  worker  |||  .
|||  brazil  |||  sets a release date for zelaya
the  |||  brazilian  |||  government has put a deadline on manuel zelaya 's stay in the embassy in tegucigalpa .
the deposed president must  |||  leave  |||  the embassy by the 27th of january , 2010 at the latest , when his mandate officially ends .
francisco catunda , the chargé d'affaires of the brazilian embassy in the honduran capital , told tv globo that " mel " knows that he must  |||  leave  |||  the embassy , where he has been a refugee since 21st september , before that date .
" he is  |||  aware  |||  that he has to leave on january 27th , the end of his term ; he has to look for another occupation . "
the station also quoted the former president , who confirmed his intention to  |||  leave  |||  the embassy before the deadline : " my plan is to leave as soon as possible , obviously with the support of the brazilian government , " zelaya said via telephone .
following the november 29th elections ( in which profiro lobo was  |||  elected  |||  ) , zelaya said that he would remain in the embassy until january .
however , this very week , he  |||  tried  |||  to find refuge in brazil .
the  |||  operation  |||  finally ended unsuccessfully with the rejection of zelaya 's political refugee status , which the government headed by roberto micheletti tried to impose " de facto " .
|||  thanks  |||  a lot
after days of wine and roses from  |||  last  |||  spring , when inflation was the prevailing trend on the markets , uncertainty again rears its ugly head , which is not surprising since it is their natural state , in an environment in which agents make decisions about the naturally uncertain future .
the central banks have already  |||  confirmed  |||  that direct purchases of assets have practically ended and , without questioning their unorthodox liquidity policy , are beginning to throw a spanner in the works as the ecb makes its yearly auction next week .
therefore , investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain  |||  economic  |||  recovery without such unorthodox measures , and we are seeing a reversal of the reduction in risk premiums .
the volatility of the stock markets and the corporate bond spreads have swiftly picked up again , even though they are far behind the extreme levels that they  |||  reached  |||  at the beginning of the year .
spain hardly seems to have been affected by this period of instability , but that 's when standard and poor 's arrived and  |||  threatened  |||  a new revision , downgrading the kingdom of spain .
furthermore , some uncertainty does n't hurt to silence defenders of moral hazard , who again tried to raise awareness of those  |||  responsible  |||  for the global economic policy by having stopped the destructive effects derived from credit restrictions on the loss of jobs , when what should be done is to declare a new thanksgiving day .
however , dubai 's paints with a tribal fight between the emirs to restore power in the emirates , and we 've already  |||  seen  |||  it before in greece .
a  |||  government  |||  which hides the public deficit , elections and a new government that pulls up the rug .
prodi did it in italy after berlusconi , and socrates in  |||  portugal  |||  after barroso .
what is logical is that ecofin has forced the greek government to be transparent , and make its citizens jointly  |||  responsible  |||  for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances .
if , as we hope , we find ourselves before a standardized period of transient risk premiums , after some excess of leveraged  |||  positions  |||  , it would be within our expectations .
in the case of spain , since our public debt is spreading like the european  |||  corporate  |||  bonds , we should not be worried .
if the european spreads decrease and  |||  ours  |||  continue to expand , then it would be an idiosyncratic risk for spain .
that of standard & poor 's is an anecdote . when our leading indicators are forcing the majority of research services to anticipate its recovery scenarios and to revise up its scenario for 2011 , including the oecd and the european commission , they  |||  return  |||  to the fray with a japanese scenario for the spanish economy , and long life expectancy does not portend its warning .
again , it has all the earmarks to be an excellent opportunity to buy  |||  spanish  |||  assets , but for now , " prudence , my driver . "
|||  related  |||  sectors
the iberdrola chairman , ignacio sanchez galan , was the first to speak yesterday before the subcommittee of the house of representatives , where spain 's  |||  energy  |||  strategy for the next two decades is currently being debated .
after his speech , which was  |||  followed  |||  by the president of gas natural - fenosa , rafael villaseca , galan gave the press a few glimpses of what was planned in the subcommittee behind closed doors .
for the president of iberdrola , spain needs to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion between that  |||  date  |||  and 2030 , while they keep operating the nuclear power plants which are presently open .
otherwise , the  |||  investments  |||  required will not be 60 billion , but up to 95 billion .
yes , iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be spent on  |||  increasing  |||  its generating capacity , but on distribution networks and on international interconnections .
from 2020 on , the matter changes and the power will have to  |||  increase  |||  .
his bet is in both coal  |||  plants  |||  withcarbon dioxide catchers and , especially , renewable sources of energy .
in this case , he considers that it takes 18,000 new mw , and that is with "  |||  support  |||  energy . "
though he believes that the sustainable economy act , which the government has just approved , is in line with what his company has been calling for , galan would not draw blood with a royal decree to  |||  promote  |||  the consumption of domestic coal , which contradicts the policies to combat climate change .
as it is , galan believes that the decisions to invest , even though they are long - term , should  |||  start  |||  to be made since it has already taken a long time to think them through , and a stable framework for addressing remuneration is necessary .
ferrovial 's airport ground services subsidiary , swiss swissport , is going to be the  |||  irish  |||  airline aer lingus ' preferred partner for cargo services in ten of the european airports where it operates .
paris ,  |||  london  |||  , frankfurt and brussels are among the most prominent .
the agreement , which has not transcended  |||  economic  |||  terms , will last for five years .
moreover , ferrovial , the autonomous government of castile - la mancha , and the university of alcala de henares  |||  signed  |||  a protocol of cooperation yesterday to create a center for the innovation of intelligent infrastructure .
the alliance includes an  |||  investment  |||  of 20 million by 2012 , 50 % of which comes from ferrovial .
one of the center'stasks will be to research  |||  energy  |||  efficiency on highways and in airports .
acciona disputes its first highway in  |||  australia  |||  with hotchief and bouygues .
acciona is struggling for its first highway concession in australia , a market where it already operates as a an  |||  energy  |||  and water company .
the  |||  construction  |||  involves a 1.7 billion australian dollar tunnel ( about 1.047 billion euros ) .
the  |||  french  |||  bouygues and german hotchief are its rivals .
a 5 - km tunnel in the australian city of brisbane , on the east coast , has become the closest chance for accionato settle in the countryas a  |||  construction  |||  and motorway company .
after opting for the public - private partnership ( the acronym ppp in english ) to move the project forward , in a  |||  business  |||  plan under the tutelage of ernst & young , the administration already has a final list of candidates to take over the work and exploit the toll .
depending on the bids submitted by next may , the planned investment comes to 1.7 billion australian dollars ( 1.047 billion euros ) and three consortia , with a remarkable predominance of european construction firms , are competing in the  |||  final  |||  stage .
the group known as transcity , is headed by acciona , the only spanish one in the  |||  competition  |||  , and its partners are bmd and ghella .
the first is a  |||  major  |||  australian construction company , while the second , based in italy , is one of europe 's leading specialists in undergroundconstructions .
the northern district consortium is pitted against acciona 's team , with the presence of britain 's laing o'rourke , the australian infrastructure group transfield , and the  |||  french  |||  construction group bouygues .
the third and  |||  final  |||  consortium to make it through the selection process is called lbrjv , where australia 's leighton ( a subsidiary of the german construction company hochtief , owned in turn by acs ) , domestic baulderstone ( owned by the german group bilfinger berger ) and razel , the gallic firm specializing in civil construction , split the capital .
the australian infrastructures market promises big jobs and privatization , but it carries a clear start - up  |||  difficulty  |||  if it 's not leaning towards hiring a local construction company .
it is one strategy that the aforementioned hochtief and bilfinger , in addition to asian shareholders , have pursued , and one that remains unresolved for the  |||  spanish  |||  giants in the industry .
acs barely  |||  acquired  |||  a position in that market through its 30 % stake in hochtief , theproprietor of the aforementioned leighton .
|||  asset  |||  millionaires
acciona is bidding on a geographical location of the utmost importance for the sector , which already has a strong presence from its activity as an energy provider and the desalination  |||  business  |||  .
among other assets , it has the largest wind farm , waubra wind farm ( 192 mw ) in victoria , and leads the corporate groupresponsible for  |||  building  |||  and managing the desalination plant in adelaida with a budget of 700 million .
now it intends to consolidate these two areas and exploit synergies in the fields of  |||  construction  |||  and infrastructure operations .
the underground toll road , sponsored by the brisbane department of infrastructure and the northern link , is calledupon to connect the toowong western highway with the bypass in kelvin grove ( see map ) through the 5 - kilometer tunnel . it is a  |||  major  |||  endeavor to reduce the traffic in brisbane .
the timetable set by the administration sets the deadline for the decision in the summer of 2010 and for the work to  |||  start  |||  in december of next year .
although this toll road would be  |||  open  |||  for traffic in the closing months of 2014 , the work is not anticipated to be completed until 2016 .
it will  |||  include  |||  two lanes in each direction , an electric toll system and a sophisticated ventilation system .
the queensland government will provide 500 million dollars ( 308 million euros ) for  |||  funding  |||  .
the firm , owned in - part by acs , will set up the  |||  national  |||  broadband infrastructure with fiber optic cables through its local subsidiary , leighton .
this will provide high - speed internet access to 400,000 people and will provide work for the german  |||  firm  |||  for 18 months .
moreover , the company has transferred the project to build the 27 - story high king george tower in the australian city of brisbane . the work has yet to  |||  begin  |||  , and hochtief has closed the sale for 129 million .
presently , in the u.k. , more specifically in manchester , laing o'rourke will partake in the  |||  construction  |||  and operation of two schools over 25 years .
the initial  |||  investment  |||  will total 75 million euros .
fcc awarded a tunnel in  |||  slovenia  |||  for 64 million
fcc , through its subsidiary alpine , has been awarded the  |||  construction  |||  of a 2.1 - kilometer - long tunnel for a highway in slovenia for 64.5 million euros .
the firm  |||  received  |||  this contract days after getting bosruck 's ( austria ) tunnel expansion job .
by doing this , alpine is strengthening its expertise in tunnel  |||  construction  |||  .
the construction is  |||  planned  |||  to start in the beginning of 2010 , and the project timeframe will span 32 months .
renfe has appropriated approximately three million euros annually for the advertising and marketing services of the sra . rushmore agency for the next two years , the railway operator  |||  reported  |||  .
the contract covers the possibility of two 12 - month extensions . sra . rushmore has been  |||  chosen  |||  from the 16 agencies that entered the tender launched by renfe , of which there were four finalists ; among them was tbwa , which was in charge of creatives for the past 3 years .
from this  |||  point  |||  forward , sra . rushmore will be in charge of campaign design and production .
with this sanction , the former  |||  french  |||  monopoly and state - owned company has accumulated more than 560 million euros in fines since hindering its competitors in 1994 .
the penalty imposed yesterday has , in fact ,  |||  increased  |||  because the authority that oversees the competition believes france telecom has committed similar violations in the past and , therefore , is a repeat offender .
on the other hand , the mobile subsidiary of the french company has followed in the footsteps of other operators , and has opened an on - line application shop , with the aim of  |||  increasing  |||  revenues outside of telecommunications .
it will not reach other  |||  countries  |||  , including spain , until 2010 .
|||  playing  |||  the champions league has yielded 476.4 million to madrid and barcelona since it was first established
the champions league has become a source of income for clubs  |||  since  |||  it started in 1992 .
so much so that  |||  real  |||  madrid and barcelona have collected 476.4 million , making them the third and fifth club to have won the most money in the competition .
winning the uefa champions league does n't just earn you glory . it is also a  |||  major  |||  source of income for the big clubs .
so much so that uefa figures show that the  |||  competition  |||  has dealt out 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams ( 12 of them from spain ) who have participated in the event since the tournament was founded in the 1992/1993 season .
|||  real  |||  madrid and f.c. barcelona have fared well in this distribution .
the white club has been the third on the continent to have pocketed more money from  |||  participating  |||  , and the only one , after ac milan , to have won the trophy three times .
the catalan team , the defending champion and  |||  last  |||  winner of the defunct european cup in 1992 , is fifth in the rankings .
at the top of the list are manchester united and bayern much , two teams that have also made more money by  |||  participating  |||  in the champions league .
and that is in  |||  spite  |||  of both of them losing against barcelona .
what more , spain is only the  |||  third  |||  country to have made more money through the champions league despite having earned more titles than any other country ( five , compared to italy 's four , england 's three , and germany 's two ) .
|||  distribution  |||
this apparent paradox is explained by the  |||  complicated  |||  payment system the uefa uses .
for this fiscal year the  |||  body  |||  chaired by michel platini expects to collect 1.090 billion for the champions league .
the uefa dedicates 413.1 million of that money to pay  |||  fixed  |||  rates : each of the 20 clubs participating in the prequalifying round ( including atletico madrid ) receives 2.1 million .
additionally , those who managed to participate  |||  received  |||  3.8 million just for being there , in addition to another 550,000 euros for every game they play .
there are also bonuses for winning ( 800,000 euros ) and for ties ( 400,000 for each team ) . the octa - finalists  |||  receive  |||  three million each ; the eight quarterfinalists , 3.3 million .
the  |||  last  |||  four will pocket 4 million each .
the champion will win 9  |||  million  |||  , versus the 5.2 million for the runner - up .
so , with the idea of the fixed rates , a club takes home at least 7.1  |||  million  |||  , and at most 31.2 million .
barcelona on the other hand pocketed 2.5 million for winning the  |||  european  |||  super cup in august .
but there are other varying  |||  payments  |||  to which 337.8 million are allocated .
last year 's champion got 40 % of the  |||  allocated  |||  money , 30 % for second place , 20 % for third , 10 % for fourth .
the other part will be  |||  paid  |||  according to the number of games played this year .
nueva rumasa  |||  offers  |||  61 million euros for 29.9 % of sos
yesterday , the nueva rumasa holding company sifted through the  |||  details  |||  of the bid on shares which led to the acquisition of a stake of between 25 % and 29.9 % in sos .
it is a percentage which does n't require them to launch a takeover bid ( opa ) for all of the  |||  securities  |||  .
sos shares closed yesterday at 1.85 euros ; so , nueva rumasa 's  |||  offer  |||  undervalued the company 18 % below the market value .
according to nueva rumasa , the price of 1.50 euros reflects the  |||  real  |||  value of sos .
the jerezano group is  |||  giving  |||  a period of 15 days for shareholders to express their interest in selling securities .
the cnmv assured that it had not been informed of the  |||  offer  |||  , despite ruiz mateos ' company saying that it had contacted a regulator .
if this comes to fruition , the payout would  |||  reach  |||  611.7 million when the capitalization of sos is at 254.27 million .
meanwhile , sos is restructuring its  |||  management  |||  .
this is a newly created position which reports directly to the  |||  president  |||  of the group .
and not without controversy , as the company is still immersed in the legal  |||  battle  |||  for the alleged diversion of over 230 million from sos to the salazar brothers ' holding company .
in fact , it 's possible that sos will reveal further diversions of funds in the  |||  next  |||  few months .
in regards to the salazars '  |||  credit  |||  , the former advisers ildefonso ortega and angel fernandez noriega ( representatives of ccm and unicaja ) testified and affirmed that they approved of the diversion of 212 million without knowing where the money was going .
cnmv authorized the  |||  exclusion  |||  take - over bid submitted by inversora mer
yesterday , the  |||  national  |||  securities market commission ( cnmv ) approved of the exclusion take - over bid of federico paternina by inversora mer , which was presented last october 9th .
the supervisory agency explained that this operation is authorized after it is  |||  understood  |||  that its terms adjust to existing standards and that the information packet 's contents , submitted after the amendments introduced last december 2nd , are considered sufficient .
the cnmv has stated that the  |||  offer  |||  addresses the purchase of 550,008 shares of federico paternina at 7.65 euros a share , representing 8.95 % of its share capital , which consists of 6,142,786 shares that are traded on the stock exchanges in madrid and bilbao .
it also explained that it has frozen 5,592,778 million shares , which will not be traded in any way until the completion of the offer , which specified the price  |||  determined  |||  by frederico paternina in accordance with current regulations .
new tools for inspecting  |||  cars  |||
in these  |||  days  |||  of storms and accidents , it is not only garages that are making a profit .
|||  every  |||  day , thousands of cars that have been in accidents are towed to a garage , where a technician must evaluate the damage and what the repair will cost .
no claim is the same , and calculating the cost of parts and labor can be a long and  |||  complicated  |||  task .
manually calculating the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros , including  |||  parts  |||  and labor , may take two or three hours .
this is why almost 100 % of technicians are using this  |||  kind  |||  of system .
the other firms in the sector ,  |||  competing  |||  in the field of data assessment and processing , are gtmotive and eurotax .
|||  working  |||  with data supplied by manufacturers is far from simple .
according to eduardo velazquez , the audatex business manager , 63 manufacturers and importers are working in spain , and each of them submits data in a  |||  different  |||  format .
furthermore , the amount of data to process is  |||  increasing  |||  to the point where they have released more versions , variants and engines in the last five years than in the previous 15 .
when a new car hits the market , these  |||  companies  |||  get to work .
it 's very arduous work because you have to catalog  |||  each  |||  of the thousands of vehicle parts andenter in your price .
in addition , a " smart " graphic is made for  |||  each  |||  model , where you can " click " on different parts of the car .
if it is a mass - market model , the work can be ready in a week ,  |||  provided  |||  the process goes quickly .
if it 's an uncommon car , it can take up to three or four months . currently , audatex provides comprehensive data for 99.2 % of the cars  |||  sold  |||  in spain .
among the most exclusive models , information is available for a porsche , but not a  |||  ferrari  |||  or lamborghini for example .
in order to document and  |||  develop  |||  the databases , audatex has eight centers scattered around the world ( spain , france , germany , usa , brazil , mexico , china and japan ) , and each of these specializes in a specific brand .
its  |||  national  |||  headquarters is in alcobendas ( madrid ) .
there , over a hundred technicians ( usually  |||  expert  |||  mechanics ) work with three computer screens at the same time .
audatex invests 90 million euros a year in  |||  developing  |||  these databases .
every month , 2.5 million pieces of information are added , and clients  |||  receive  |||  updates every two days .
the most common use focuses on maintenance and repair , but depending on the country , there are also tools to  |||  manage  |||  scrap pieces and to calculate the market and residual value of a car .
the only company with a used car  |||  guide  |||  available in spain is eurotax .
audatex does n't offer one in our country , but it does in the united  |||  states  |||  .
in  |||  view  |||  of the products that audatex offers , it is easy to get an idea of the kind of support available to professionals in this sector .
it includes cars , motorcycles , and light and  |||  heavy  |||  industrial vehicles .
besides the cost of  |||  parts  |||  , it includes manufacturer estimates of repair times and paint charts .
this tool charges according to the use , for  |||  each  |||  appraisal .
the highest  |||  cost  |||  is 5.75 euros for customers who rarely use it , 10 times a month at most .
other products , like audavin , facilitate the  |||  complete  |||  identification of a vehicle and the equipment that it left the assembly line with , just from its vehicle identification number .
audaglass focuses on the glass parts of a car , and audasubastas is an on - line service open to the  |||  professional  |||  sector which facilitates the bidding on vehicles calssed as write - offs .
you can study , for example , how many models of a particular make have gone to a shop because of malfunctions or how many have been in  |||  serious  |||  accidents in a certain period .
gt motive is the only spanish company working to  |||  develop  |||  these kinds of tools .
it sells , among others , the gt estimate , which is again  |||  designed  |||  for technicians and also provides digital images , access to parts and the manufacturer 's official prices and times .
gt motive is a grupo einsa company , which was founded in 1971 as a provider of automotive services and solutions for assessing damage , malfunctions and  |||  maintenance  |||  .
the gt appraisal guide is its historical  |||  reference  |||  product on the market .
they work with 24,000  |||  users  |||  in garages , 3,100 technicians and 53 insurance companies .
its turnover has grown by 20 % per year over the past  |||  three  |||  years , and it brought in 10.8 million euros in 2008 .
meanwhile , audatex was founded in  |||  germany  |||  in 1966 and set up shop in spain in 1979 .
according to company sources , 62 % of its business is generated in europe and the rest of the world , and the remaining 37 % in north and south  |||  america  |||  . they work with more than 900 insurance companies and 33,000 shops , 3,000 of which are in spain .
in our country , the company brought in 19.1 million euros , 7.2 % more than  |||  last year  |||  .
in 2005 , grupo solera was valued at 1 billion dollars on the stock exchange , and its  |||  shares  |||  are now listed for a total of 2.4 billion dollars .
it is been listed on the nyse since 2007 and is included in standard &  |||  poor  |||  's reference index .
|||  last  |||  october , grupo solera bought autoonline , an internet platform for selling cars , motorcycles , and especially damaged vehicles .
the aim of the acquisition was to offer more value -  |||  added  |||  services to its customers , with the possibility of reaching an immense international market .
this appraisal and buying and selling service is directed exclusively at professionals in the sector , such as insurance companies , technicians , renting agencies , shops , scrap yards , and  |||  professional  |||  sellers who must register before using it .
this platform was created in germany in 1996 , and it manages more than 650,000 transactions  |||  throughout  |||  europe , 500,000 of them in germany .
its major markets include spain , greece ,  |||  poland  |||  and turkey .
the site currently has more than 1,500  |||  registered  |||  sellers and 4,000 technicians .
it oversees 3,000 listings a day , and around 100 new listings are added  |||  every  |||  day on the spanish market .
under spanish law , a car whose vehicle identification number has been unregistered cannot be put  |||  back  |||  into circulation but can be used for undamaged spare parts .
cars with  |||  historical  |||  value can be registered , even though they have been unregistered , after a lengthy registration process .
user friendliness is an  |||  essential  |||  condition for these systems , especially to convincing older technicians , who , to varying degrees , are usually more reluctant to use new management techniques .
the database includes 1,034  |||  vehicles  |||  , 666 of which are cars , 109 sport - utility vehicles , 137 motorcycles , 78 vans and 44 trucks .
naturally , a computer with an internet connection is  |||  needed  |||  to use it .
after identifying the model to be repaired by its vehicle identification number , an effective graphic image of the model appears , and then the  |||  necessary  |||  part is selected .
the user can  |||  include  |||  variables such as the price of labor , surcharges and discounts , and can then print the estimate for the client .
audataller is not an appraisal tool like audaplus , but  |||  rather  |||  a reference catalog .
the cost of  |||  using  |||  this tool in a shop is 350 euros a year , which the customer can finance .
presently , audatex is  |||  working  |||  to make these images three - dimensional .
this is an innovation mechanics are approving of because it will enable you , for example , to  |||  select  |||  a door and turn it around to see the inside .
new councilors of cssd will most probably have to overcome certain language barriers to  |||  understand  |||  their old - new colleagues from ods in prague council and municipal council .
aktuálně.cz " tested " the social democrat members of the new council in terms of the well -  |||  established  |||  slang that originated in the town hall during the few last years , when prague was ruled by the current coalition partners .
coded vocabulary that was  |||  established  |||  by prague political elite during the previous era of the mayor pavel bem , describes some of the most famous persons , situations and affairs in the city .
" i  |||  really  |||  do not know . "
" i 'm rather a novice in prague politics , " responded lukas kaucky , the councilor for culture , to the  |||  test  |||  of " godfather " vocabulary .
and even though he is a political veteran , the councilor karel brezina  |||  responded  |||  similarly .
for instance regarding the  |||  term  |||  " golf hole . "
" otherwise , i  |||  generally  |||  do not recognize the slang . "
out of the glossary ,  |||  published  |||  by aktuálně.cz last june just before the election congress of ods , editors selected six examples , mainly well - known in connection with the prague city hall .
the socialists were to explain the concepts of " voldemort , " the " greatest golf hole in prague , " " go to a candy bar , " " bull neck , " " betrayal of the  |||  capital  |||  " and " to plate with metal . "
three councilors  |||  agreed  |||  with the quiz , the fourth - antonín weinert , who is to head the education in prague in the future - promised to attend an interview first , but later he stopped answering the phone .
the fifth councilor , peter dolínek , refused the  |||  test  |||  straight away .
" voldemort " bears no meaning to kaucky and the only term he correctly guessed in the  |||  test  |||  is " the greatest golf hole in prague . "
" it 's blanka tunnel , "  |||  says  |||  kaucky , and immediately adds : " but i know it from the newspapers . "
" i 'll have to get myself a  |||  language  |||  course , " he quips .
golf hole as the blanka tunnel was then correctly deciphered by not only the matador karel brezina , but also the councilor for the  |||  environment  |||  , lukas plachy .
both social democrats then also know who is actually voldemort and lukas plachy is familiar with this character - he also guesses the right  |||  meaning  |||  of the phrase " to go to a candy bar . "
" that means going to a company in prague " he sails  |||  close  |||  to the meaning , which is the office of janousek 's companies .
similarly to brezina he notes that he gained the knowledge from the newspapers rather than  |||  using  |||  such a vocabulary himself .
according to the testees , there is no such groovy glossary of slang  |||  terms  |||  in social democrats party .
" i even consulted my colleagues , but it  |||  seems  |||  that we really do not have anything like that . "
" we rather address one another with names , sometimes we use abbreviations and  |||  name  |||  garbles , " said prague cssd chairman peter hulínský , addressed by party members as hulda .
" at school i was called birch , but i do not know if my colleagues  |||  call  |||  me so , " he admits his own nickname , karel brezina .
councilor weinert is grandpa or less  |||  friendly  |||  old man for party members , the councilor miroslav poche , who won attention just before the election by the fraud in party sponsorship , was nicknamed " igráček " by some colleagues .
hulínský reportedly does not like to be addressed as hulda , but aktuálně.cz has also seen  |||  another  |||  nickname of that prague chairman .
" dr. of black - jack law " supposedly recalls that peter hulínský got his  |||  degree  |||  of judr at the police academy in bratislava .
the government wants to  |||  limit  |||  the torture of " witches , " a brochure was released
they rather come from the older generation , cannot engage in work for  |||  health  |||  reasons for instance , are unmarried and have no children .
the one who " becomes " a witch is  |||  sent  |||  into isolation in order to not jeopardize the rest of the village .
" such a fate befalls men only very  |||  rarely  |||  . "
" nor healthy young women are sent away because they help with work and bear children , " says the nun , who takes care for more than a hundred women banished from their community in a special care  |||  home  |||  in the capital of burkina faso , west africa .
local government now decided to  |||  combat  |||  the unusual " social measures . "
it has published an information booklet , which should help  |||  limit  |||  the witch - hunt .
" more than 70 percent of adults in burkina faso cannot  |||  read  |||  , " pointed out the disadvantage of written education die standard daily .
accusations of witchcraft are also common in other  |||  african  |||  countries .
in ghana , which borders with burkina faso , a seventy - two amma hemmah died  |||  last  |||  week after three women and two men tortured her , doused in kerosene and set alight .
the case was  |||  reported  |||  by bbc .
the perpetrators  |||  claim  |||  that it was an unfortunate coincidence .
|||  according  |||  to their version the oil that is used for ritual anointing ignited and burned the woman to death .
isolation of " witches " is widely  |||  supported  |||  by people regardless of their education level .
daily der  |||  standard  |||  quoted a businessman of forty - two from burkina faso : " devourers of human souls have always posed a danger , " he said .
while in burkina faso the government is trying hard to moderate the witch hunt , the gambia 's president himself participated in the hunt  |||  last year  |||  .
" gambian president jámí after the death of his aunt unleashed a large - scale witch - hunt for witches allegedly involved in her death and trying to use  |||  black  |||  magic to kill the president . "
the arrested people had to drink a potion of herbs with hallucinogenic  |||  effects  |||  , which also causes intestinal and kidney problems .
bakala 's tenant : heating in the stove , signed the rent  |||  increase  |||
under his arm he carried a folder with new lease  |||  contracts  |||  to three flats : his , his daughter 's and his son 's , who is in prison .
all the  |||  three  |||  's rent has just risen due to deregulation .
from  |||  next  |||  year will the son pay czk 4100 for the second class 2 + 1 apartment instead of the current czk 3500 per month .
" but i  |||  signed  |||  it , " he says half angrily , half resignedly .
bytyokd.cz civic association , which identified the new tenancy conditions as " unfair and immoral , " advises tenants not to sign the new  |||  contract  |||  and wait until 7 december , when they will publish a guidance on how to counter them .
" one says this ,  |||  another  |||  that , " he frowns .
ostrava has  |||  become  |||  a great laboratory of deregulation .
after the new year the  |||  vast majority  |||  of dwellings with non - market rent in the czech republic will be subject to deregulation .
aktuálně.cz therefore decided to  |||  visit  |||  the " laboratory " itself .
havířov 's waiting room of rpg is one of the four in the ostrava region and is already  |||  full  |||  at nine a.m. on tuesda .
standing right at the door , there is a security guard from a security  |||  agency  |||  with a call device nearby .
|||  special  |||  button " rent 2011 " shines on the touch screen .
one tap and the machine issues a slip with a  |||  number  |||  .
you do not even manage to read " 157 " and your figure beeps on the  |||  large  |||  screen below the ceiling of the waiting room .
it is your turn in  |||  half  |||  a second .
an older couple comes to ask about the lease after a few moments , there is  |||  apparently  |||  no rush for new leases in the waiting room at all .
most people  |||  came  |||  to solve the same problems as usual - request for repairs , insured events etc.
rpg byty proposes to  |||  increase  |||  rent by 15 to 38 percent in these letters .
a special desk for new leases was  |||  opened  |||  on 18 november in the client center .
" it has been in operation for over a week , so it 's only run - in , "  |||  respond  |||  the clerks at the desk after some hesitation , when the client introduces himself as a journalist .
deregulation and bakala 's  |||  former  |||  mining flats are local hot topic .
before the elections , it was  |||  quite  |||  loudly adopted by parliament vice - president and a native of ostrava lubomir zaoralek of the social democrats , and even now it fills local newspapers .
it is mostly the retired who only come to see if they can i get a discount on rent if they  |||  sign  |||  on time , as rpg their promises in their special offer .
half off the february rent will also  |||  receive  |||  the other tenants who will have signed the new contract by 15 december .
havířov 's " deregulatory " desk is  |||  certainly  |||  not overwhelmed with questions .
" out of yesterday 's 360  |||  clients  |||  only about forty to fifty came to inquire about leases in 2011 , " estimates the clerk behind the counter .
rpg on their bulletin boards and web site  |||  proposed  |||  the negotiation of individual contracts where needed .
however , if the parties fail to agree on the lease , an independent tribunal will have to  |||  establish  |||  the rent .
" this is not a threat , but the information on the only possible legitimate and completely legal procedure , " says rpg on its  |||  website  |||  .
" i have czk 13,000 pension and five thousands are  |||  left  |||  for the meals , i cannot afford bringing it to the court , " he said .
" mr. zaoralek advises them in the  |||  media  |||  not to sign , so some people are waiting , " she thinks .
the regulation of rents ends in the most of the czech republic with the new year 2011 and according to rpg byty is the increase of rents an  |||  economic  |||  necessity .
" the current rent is still less than the amount needed for simple maintenance of housing stock , " commented pavel klimes , director of rpg portfolio of residential apartments , and reminded that neglect of the housing stock complained about in relation just to those angry tenants , is the main reason for the  |||  increase  |||  in rents according to the house owners .
while within the five years between 2005 and 2010 could rpg invest  |||  four  |||  billion from the rents into the apartments , within the four years between 2011 and 2014 it should be 5.2 billion .
" the  |||  increase  |||  in rents in 2011 by 15 % and less concerns 31,200 flats , it is more than 90 % of rpg apartments . "
" in these cases there will be an increase from an extremely low amount of czk 19.66 per square meter , "  |||  points  |||  rpg .
in 2600 apartments will the rent remain the same  |||  next  |||  year .
it adds another commitment : all the money from rent increases ( see the chart ) will be invested by the company  |||  back  |||  to the flats , especially in heat savings - new windows and insulation .
priority will be given to people who sign the agreement to  |||  increase  |||  rents .
avriopoint office  |||  building  |||  in brno is the new headquarters of arch . design company .
it indeed employs nearly 90 people - mainly baby - boom - aged and they want their  |||  female  |||  designers and architects to quickly return to work .
along with the possibility of part - time contracts the kindergarten is a benefit that arch . design offers to their employees within their  |||  welfare  |||  program .
female construction engineers and architects have thus the opportunity to combine their  |||  demanding  |||  jobs with child care .
tinz kindergarten has been invented by arch . design employees  |||  themselves  |||  and with the support from management they were able to obtain a grant of the european union and the ministry of labour and social affairs .
corporate tiny kindergarten is  |||  funded  |||  by the european social fund through the operational program human resources and employment and state budget of cz .
thanks to grant funding ( subsidy of 2.8 million ) they were able to purchase equipment and for the period of two years  |||  provide  |||  qualified personnel and operation .
after the depletion of financial aid ( 2 years ) the arch . design company must  |||  operate  |||  the kindergarten for 3 years at its own expense .
preparation of the project lasted one year and the economy rating company  |||  helped  |||  with the applications for grant significantly .
the care is  |||  provided  |||  by qualified staff , children are taken care of by a nurse and a kindergarten teacher all day ; the kindergarten can therefore be attended by children without any age restrictions , but most of them are over 3 years old .
as this is a " mini - kindergarten , " only 5 children may be  |||  present  |||  at the same time , even though more can attend in the course of the day altogether .
the operation of the kindergarten is flexible to the needs of parents and children of all employees have the same  |||  right  |||  to use the nursery , regardless of the position in the company hierarchy .
|||  although  |||  this is an individual education and care , the program content in the mini - kindergarten is comparable with the framework program of preschool education .
children are not only playing here , they are also  |||  provided  |||  with quality teaching - from basic knowledge to preparation for schooling and english is also taught here .
the  |||  class  |||  is not only equipped with toys , inspiring games , but also with a computer that children can use .
the presence of small children directly in the company creates a  |||  friendly  |||  and positive environment .
parents can always  |||  check  |||  their child and it prevents stress situations related to delayed pick - up from nurseries located far from their parents " workplace .
parents then use the  |||  working  |||  time much more efficiently .
arch . design became one of the czech companies , which offer  |||  significant  |||  benefit when recruiting new employees , they are friendly to the family and through this program they have enhanced personnel marketing .
|||  house  |||  of bones fascinates even after 100 years . look at the interiors by gaudi
the roof looks like a prehistoric lizard 's spine , the staircase reminds of a dinosaur backbone and balconies are  |||  open  |||  fish mouths .
this is the  |||  house  |||  of casa batlló in barcelona by the catalan architect antoni gaudí .
the locals started to call it the house of bones for its  |||  organic  |||  shapes .
|||  organic  |||  shapes , wild colors , unusual use of stone , fragments of tiles and mosaics , facade reminiscent of scales and soft curves everywhere , all of which are typical of art nouveau by antoni gaudí .
the facade of the house opens dreamy  |||  lines  |||  , soft colors and textures reminiscent of nature and animals .
the investor , a wealthy industrialist josep batlló , initially insisted on the demolition of the old building and construction of an entirely new one , but soon he  |||  adopted  |||  gaudi 's idea of an unusual and cheaper redevelopment of the house .
apartment building casa batlló was nevertheless not designed by antoni gaudí  |||  alone  |||  .
architect josep maria jujol  |||  cooperated  |||  with him .
a  |||  number  |||  of other authors and artists worked on the facade .
jujol took part in the construction of gaudi 's building casa mila and park guell , which contains other gaudi 's  |||  works  |||  .
the locals started to call it the "  |||  house  |||  of bones " for its organic shapes soon after its completion .
others began to  |||  call  |||  it a " yawning house " for its specific mechanism of windows opening .
it is also said that on top of the building there is a representation of the sword of st. george , the patron of  |||  catalonia  |||  .
other sculptural elements of the  |||  building  |||  also contain hidden religious motives .
gaudi designed a central heating system in the house ,  |||  unique  |||  for his time , with ventilation and typical chimneys .
their forty - five degree slope may  |||  seem  |||  bizarre .
when  |||  creating  |||  gaudi totally disregarded building regulations of the time and did not let them tied him up .
at the start of construction he actually  |||  received  |||  a building permit from the city , but the provided details about the planned reconstruction were so vague , that two years after the completion the city council was horrified by the result and asked for redress .
the correction never happened , rather the opposite : only fifteen days after the request from the city , josep batlló applied for ( and successfully  |||  received  |||  ) the permission to lease the top two floors of the building .
there was a banquet hall in the gallery on the second floor and on the third floor there was a bedroom and a  |||  private  |||  section of the apartment .
the key elements of the reconstruction were the abolition of all right angles and straight  |||  lines  |||  and replacing them with curved walls .
gaudí also  |||  worked  |||  with the modern concept of space interconnection .
the  |||  house  |||  won due to gaudi 's rebuilding a new facade and also the unusual roof and two extra floors .
gaudi 's play with  |||  light  |||  is also impressive , along with blue and white glazed tiles used to line the inner courtyard and skylights .
the play of two colors delivers a  |||  maximum  |||  of light on all floors of the house .
it was enough to gamble on the principle that white reflects  |||  light  |||  more than dark colors , which absorb the sun 's rays on the contrary .
casa batlló house , which was included in unesco world heritage fund in 2005 , can be visited by  |||  anyone  |||  .
the owners decided to  |||  move  |||  this up in 2002 to celebrate the one hundred fiftieth anniversary of the birth of the famous author .
they kept providing the excursions since they discovered that this is a very profitable business , plus they  |||  extended  |||  tours by the common and attic spaces , including a roof terrace .
the amount greatly exceeds the  |||  price  |||  of admission to other gaudi 's buildings in the city .
if you want to experience the true atmosphere of the house with dragon towers , you have to quickly make friends with any of the inhabitants of the apartment house and visit them at  |||  home  |||  .
how to choose the mattress and the slatted bed base :  |||  women  |||  have different requirements from men
not luxurious bed frame , but the quality of the lying area , that is the mattress and slatted bed base  |||  gives  |||  a really good bed .
the selection decisions are influenced by lots of things such as the  |||  weight  |||  , height , age , health , and gender of the owner .
a typical  |||  example  |||  ?
in addition , they tend to have significantly higher  |||  weight  |||  than a standard polyurethane foam mattress .
it is also necessary to  |||  turn  |||  them regularly .
if they do not have enough venting channels in their  |||  core  |||  , and still lie on a hard board , they retain moisture : even mold could occur beneath the mattresses .
who  |||  spent  |||  more time abroad , where they often use very thick mattresses with softening layer , they will find it hard to feel good on a thin one with hard surface .
" their battered shoulders , heels and hips  |||  needed  |||  the mattress to be softened with a layer of lazy foam . "
" those are  |||  recommended  |||  even for people with diabetes who have a nervous system disorder , so they assume ' information ' from the joints and skin in an ill way , " explains sylvia hadamczikova , who specializes in upholstered furniture .
she therefore looked for lazy foam mattresses for many hockey players , but also other  |||  customers  |||  years ago .
" now it 's okay , suitable mattresses can be found at tempur ,  |||  italian  |||  magniflex , but also czech tropico . "
this "  |||  miracle  |||  " works in a simple manner .
optimizes its rigidity and  |||  shape  |||  by the heat absorbed or adapts to your body warm .
you will just sleep  |||  better  |||  .
lazy foam also  |||  works  |||  well as a protection against pressure sores .
when  |||  choosing  |||  the size of your mattress thickness , add one foot length to your height , which is about 21-34 cm .
in  |||  separate  |||  beds , for example for singles , it is recommended at least 120 to 140 cm .
" otherwise the rule for bed width is simple : when lying on your back , you should  |||  keep  |||  your hands comfortably slightly bent at the elbow , " advises ing . helena prokopová , head of the guild of upholsterers and decorators , who has addressed the issue of healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture for many years and teaches it to colleges .
otherwise you will have to fit into slatted bases into  |||  different  |||  heights , which may not be possible with every frame of the bed .
" you must not  |||  feel  |||  the springs when touching the mattress with hands or sitting down on the mattress , " warns helena prokopova .
each mattress requires a  |||  certain  |||  type of slatted base .
and since we normally perspire 0.2 to 0.75 liters of sweat during the night , it is  |||  obvious  |||  that after five to seven years the mattress will resemble a large ( and clogged ) sieve .
that 's why experts  |||  refuse  |||  advertising slogans of life of the mattress up to 25 years , or even a lifetime warranty .
|||  everything  |||  has its pros and cons .
although today mattress covers are now commonly manufactured with a zip around the perimeter , so after opening you get two parts (  |||  vital  |||  for washing and the size of washing machine ! ) , handling the larger types when removing them ( and in one person ) may remind of a match of light - weight fightnig a heavy one in the ring .
do you have a fixed plate in the bed  |||  instead  |||  of a slatted base ?
|||  never  |||  !
polyurethane mattresses should not be on such a  |||  basis  |||  .
for men whose shoulders are " all over their  |||  back  |||  , " this is certainly an important thing .
they also  |||  remember  |||  the women - those indulge in the softer surface of the hip area .
but be careful when you use a  |||  wrong  |||  pillow with a correct mattress and slatted base ( large and " stuffed " ) , most of the " pluses " will disappear .
the basic rule is  |||  simple  |||  : the cushion should support the head and touch the shoulders with its corners so that the shoulder muscles could relax .
a suitable size of 50 x 60 cmis  |||  recommended  |||  , preferred for example in scandinavia .
when lying on the side , the pillow should be able to deal ( along with the shoulder cradle of the slatted bed or softened  |||  zone  |||  in the mattress ) with shoulder height .
modern mattresses do have something in common with  |||  original  |||  mattresses filled with grasses .
their manufacturers increasingly use  |||  natural  |||  materials , or at least admixtures .
there is  |||  simply  |||  an organic trend even in mattresses .
raw materials from oil , out of which polyurethane foam is made , are being replaced with  |||  natural  |||  oils , such as from soy and castor - oil plant .
it is just soy that all well - known  |||  manufacturers  |||  use now .
" organic in mattresses means that the  |||  core  |||  is made of purely natural material , " explains petr vasicek from the company tropico plus .
|||  natural  |||  products are also used in the production of mattress covers , one of the first was aloe vera .
but you can also indulge in microcapsules that can release  |||  fresh  |||  scent of lavender or forest .
there is even a division for men and  |||  women  |||  .
the extract of red pepper  |||  increases  |||  circulation of blood , so the weaker sex feels warmer .
mattress made of cold foam ( with larger pores with a damaged cell structure is more breathable than  |||  regular  |||  polyurethane and has a better elasticity .
combining  |||  different  |||  stiffnesses of cold foams and " lazy " foam result in multi - zone mattresses that know exactly where the head should be , as well as shoulders and heels .
you will pay seven thousand crowns and  |||  above  |||  for a good quality mattress .
those that  |||  meet  |||  health parameters tend to have lower rate of vat as they are considered medical equipment .
gumotex was the first to employ this advantage in the  |||  czech  |||  republic .
it is not easy to  |||  save  |||  on the mattress and the slatted base .
sometimes you can use special offers of manufacturers or retailers , who  |||  offer  |||  two mattresses for the price of one .
however , you can get the  |||  second  |||  one for free .
the era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with  |||  open  |||  cell structure and high density was started by tempur material in a " cosmic " pace .
it is then perfectly adapted to warm human  |||  body  |||  and spreads its pressure optimally .
it is therefore ideal to prevent pressure ulcer development , but also to  |||  enhance  |||  comfort while sleeping .
viscoelastic foams are used not only for mattresses , but also  |||  medical  |||  products , such as special pillows under the feet , which mitigate the legs and venous system .
domestic  |||  producers  |||  use the foam twinsaver or eucatherm c and such .
devices for people  |||  monitoring  |||  are required by more and more parents , who want to watch their children
many people have been scared by the case of missing annie and thus  |||  began  |||  to search for ways to protect their children better .
even at the cost of disruption to their  |||  privacy  |||  .
" we say to all that it is not spying , but a means to further  |||  reduce  |||  the probability that a tragedy happens , " said petr pilin of the macro weil , one of the suppliers of surveillance equipment on the czech market .
" i admit that under  |||  certain  |||  circumstances it may lead to misuse of such equipment , if they are put in a bag of someone who does not know it , but we have not seen such cases yet . "
" most customers actually buy it for  |||  security  |||  reasons , " he added .
according to him , the child should always know for what the purpose of the " box " is and how it is used in an  |||  emergency  |||  .
|||  child  |||  psychologist dana bočková points out that if a child does not want to wear something like that , it will just get rid of it .
" even very young children  |||  show  |||  great creativity how to lose some things on purpose if they do not want to be under control . "
" great parents ' expectations were fueled by cell phones before , but those can be switched off as well as this tracking device , "  |||  says  |||  bočková .
according to her it is questionable whether , in the event of an attack such a device would really  |||  help  |||  .
" as for the upcoming kidnapping , the perpetrator almost always ensures that the child should not carry any electronics that  |||  might  |||  reveal his position . "
" it 's the  |||  phone  |||  now . "
" when tracking devices get more common , they will look for those , because their sales will certainly be  |||  supported  |||  by massive advertising . "
" in this case , the criminals are always one step ahead of police , "  |||  says  |||  the psychologist .
she admits , however , that  |||  similar  |||  devices may help in case of sudden attack by a pedophile .
according to robert cech of rc monitoring company that provides tracking services for both cars and for people , even when there is an attack and immediate destruction of the tracking device , its presence can  |||  help  |||  .
" the device can be set to  |||  send  |||  regular position report after a certain period of time . "
" if it becomes damaged , we will have at least the  |||  last  |||  position of the person . "
" the more expensive devices have in - built and tiltmeters , so even if one just skids and remains lying motionless , the device immediately sends a warning with  |||  location  |||  , " says czech .
according to him a similar service may be provided by  |||  smart  |||  mobile phones with navigation , where it is enough to load a special software .
the problem of current surveillance units lies in the fact that it is either a device  |||  similar  |||  to pendants of matchbox size or smaller mobile phones .
there is always the risk of their  |||  loss  |||  .
according to pilin from the macro weil company a device that looks like a conventional digital  |||  watch  |||  is now being tested .
whether you the tracking devices develop into bracelets or pendants , they are still  |||  using  |||  the same technology as that used for monitoring vehicles .
it is a combination of location detection via gps ( used by regular car navigation ) and the functions of a mobile phone , which reports the  |||  current  |||  vehicle position .
already last year the ministry of  |||  defence  |||  delivered 224 km of the cords lines into the warehouses .
the army  |||  thus  |||  has reserves for 225 years .
the  |||  general  |||  staff provided the reasoning for buying such a huge quantity of igniter cords to mf dnes stating that soldiers use 60 km of igniter cords in training per year .
calculations of army bomb disposal experts that the mf dnes approached imply that it would be a very intense pyrotechnic  |||  training  |||  that would be undergone also by all the generals every year , along with the officers of the army , secretaries and cleaners .
and even if it were  |||  true  |||  , the army reserves would be enough for more than ten years .
however , if the basic  |||  training  |||  of any new professional actually needed just two meters of the igniter cord , as the experts say , then the army has ensured by the purchase - even with increased consumption by engineer or special units - the stock for the above 225 years .
rapid deployment brigade soldiers personally complained recently to the minister vondra that they have almost no ammunition for small arms and so shootings are  |||  limited  |||  due to shortage of money .
not mentioning the  |||  lack  |||  of underwear .
" but it 's their decision , and they  |||  certainly  |||  know what they will use them for . "
" for us , the army is a good customer , whose demands we try to  |||  meet  |||  as retailers , " says the sales manager of stv group , jan děcký .
|||  defense  |||  ministry spokesman jan pejsek reasons for the purchased hundreds of kilometers of cords by creation reserves of such " munitions " for ten years at least .
jan děcký of stv group , however , speaks only of the four - year life of the cords and police or army deminers even of  |||  mere  |||  two years .
" if stored under  |||  perfect  |||  conditions , it can be even four , " said one , who as a soldier does not want to disclose the name when criticizing the military .
after expiry date any ammunition must be carefully tested for reliability to make  |||  sure  |||  it does not endanger the life of soldiers .
these tests are not  |||  free  |||  and it cost more money .
|||  another  |||  argument of the ministry is the quantity discount on 445 km of the ignition cords .
" it cost us about sixty percent less than last year 's supply of two hundred forty - four kilometers , " says the speaker pejsek the  |||  opinion  |||  of buyers of the ministry of defence .
a police orders only such amount of the ammunition that would be used  |||  before  |||  its expiration .
ministry of defence has already considerable problems with the liquidation of tens of thousand tons of ammunition from the  |||  times  |||  of the warsaw pact , when the two - hundred - thousand czechoslovak army was preparing to set off for the rhine .
the czech one , according to the pyrotechnicians approached by mf dnes , will  |||  face  |||  the same problem in a few years : they will dispose of hundreds of kilometers of old igniter cords that are currently " cheaply " purchased .
to this day i use the contacts i gained through the  |||  competition  |||
winning the prize in the entrepreneur of the year  |||  helped  |||  lukas pytloun sell the franchise of his hotel .
the winner of  |||  last  |||  year 's entrepreneur of the year was a twenty - eight - year - old entrepreneur lukas pytloun from liberec .
his  |||  success  |||  story is much like one from a movie .
and abroad he realized that liberec lacks quality accommodation at a  |||  reasonable  |||  price .
|||  using  |||  his savings from foreign part - time jobs and a bank loan he purchased a ruined house with five apartments .
it was a great courage considering that at that time he was still a student of the  |||  third  |||  year at university .
" the ratio between quality and  |||  price  |||  of accommodation of the time in our country made me i try to do something , " says lukas pytloun .
the first renovated apartment he rented to foreign  |||  workers  |||  .
all profits were invested  |||  back  |||  into the house , which he gradually remodeled into a boarding house with 54 beds .
since then , he has managed to gradually open four guest houses in liberec within the seven years of his  |||  business  |||  , along with two stylish restaurants and two hotels with a total capacity of 300 beds across all categories of accommodation .
this year  |||  another  |||  one was open , equally good .
" we have signed a contract with a hotel in ostrov u tise , where we  |||  sold  |||  our franchise concept and others interested in the pytloun hotel franchise are applying , " says last year 's number one trader .
" and the sale of the license to  |||  operate  |||  the hotel was very much influenced just by winning the competition entrepreneur of the year , " appreciatively adds pytloun .
he  |||  strongly  |||  encourages all who are eager to try something to participate in the competition .
it is not necessary to win , any  |||  visibility  |||  is good .
he says he still draws on contacts and acquaintances , which would  |||  perhaps  |||  not get otherwise .
" with some i 've met through the competition , i started a regular  |||  business  |||  . "
in his opinion , the glory  |||  associated  |||  with the success landed a bit on each employee .
" i see them show greater loyalty and pride that they are  |||  involved  |||  in something that gained universal recognition . "
" it 's much more than just my personal success , as it is the result of good work of all of us  |||  together  |||  . "
" only my  |||  name  |||  is thrust into the forefront , " says lukáš pytloun modestly today .
i wish my successor quieter  |||  year  |||  than we had in farmet
euphoria of victory was  |||  quickly  |||  replaced by the effects of the crisis .
with self - discipline of the  |||  winner  |||  farmet has already overcome bad times .
prize for the first place in last year 's vodafone competition company of the year was in the slav  |||  house  |||  collected by the owner of farmet company , karel žďárský .
the jury then appreciated the efforts by which a small tool workshop in ceska skalice grew into a  |||  business  |||  with hundred - million turnovers .
" i can say that the award encouraged not only me but all my colleagues and  |||  increased  |||  our confidence for battles with the competition , " says the last - year winner today .
in the  |||  early  |||  history of the farmet company there was a desire to do something useful .
and so , when the state  |||  offered  |||  the father of charles žďárského to rent a small workshop to compensate for the communists - confiscated property , he did not hesitate any long , rejected a career in the company , where he was working , and with a few friends around his father he founded the company producing plastic tubs .
soon after that they  |||  began  |||  to specialize in vegetable oil presses .
after eighteen years , they  |||  became  |||  the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in central europe .
greater awareness among the general public was won after the success in the competition through the  |||  media  |||  .
|||  last  |||  year , however , was not only full of the euphoria of victories in farmet .
awards were based on  |||  firm  |||  economic performance until 2008 and only partly from 2009 .
" the situation  |||  obviously  |||  did not spare us . "
" sales  |||  fell  |||  by 40 percent , we had to restrict production and even discharge employees , " explains karel žďárský .
a viable  |||  company  |||  must be able to take even such unpopular measures sometimes .
however , they  |||  managed  |||  and retained the profit , even though lower than before the crisis .
however , what farmet would not compromise , is the investment in research and  |||  development  |||  .
" with the help of subsidies we have built a research and training center , we have enhanced our presentation at international fairs , won  |||  major  |||  awards in local exhibitions , " says žďárský .
" i wish the nice feeling of victory to the new winner , but in a more peaceful  |||  atmosphere  |||  , " says karel žďárský .
survey that removes absurd  |||  regulations  |||
poll of the absurdities is a  |||  part  |||  of the business competition for the fourth time .
some ridiculous  |||  regulations  |||  have are already been removed .
infamous winner of next year 's poll of absurdities was the absurd obligation to bring documents that are accessible for  |||  officials  |||  online to the authorities .
it was  |||  chosen  |||  by more than a third of almost four thousand votes .
for example , social security  |||  administration  |||  required a paper certificate of incorporation , although the officer can obtain one by two clicks of a mouse .
thanks to the poll , this will  |||  change  |||  .
" the czech social security administration will not  |||  require  |||  the certificate of incorporation from for controls of contributors , " said spokesman jana buráňová of cssa .
to crack down on all the rules and regulations that companies and businesses in the czech republic must  |||  meet  |||  , and remove those that lack sense , is the essence of the poll of absurdities .
if about three thousand voters were involved in the vote  |||  last  |||  year , there were nearly four thousand voters earlier this year .
and not surprisingly , there are still many legal obligations , which only serve to delay the  |||  business  |||  .
" for instance in the number of papers  |||  required  |||  for tax returns we keep the top places in the world , " said karel havlicek of the association of small and medium - sized enterprises and crafts in cr .
simplification of  |||  business  |||  has in recent years become a stated objective of all governments .
according to the world bank , in terms of  |||  business  |||  conditions the czech republic was ranked 74th position ; it is eight points less than last year .
|||  anyone  |||  may propose administrative and bureaucratic nonsenses every year from april to september , when is there is the deadline for the competition .
the absurdity that gets most votes  |||  wins  |||  .
in this survey more than a hundred , 105 to be  |||  precise  |||  , meaningless rules and regulations were filed .
among the " finalists " of the contest was for instance the requirement that the trucks for maintenance of highways were to pay road - tolls , or that businesses with twenty employees , two offices and two toilets had those painted  |||  every  |||  two years .
announcement of the competition , which always takes place in  |||  early  |||  november on wenceslas square in prague is part of the hapenning , regularly attended by personalities of the political and social life .
this year , for example , the finale of the  |||  competition  |||  was assisted by eva svobodova , director of the association of small and medium - sized enterprises and crafts in cr and petr kuzel , president of the chamber of commerce in cr .
" economic prosperity can not work where the state is throwing  |||  business  |||  in its own foot , so my goal is to annually remove at least three dozen paragraphs , which today only unnecessarily complicate the business , " said minister of industry and trade martin kocourek .
efforts to abolish meaningless  |||  regulations  |||  has rather positive load .
in 2007 most people were against the obligation of a  |||  business  |||  to report their intention to take part at the exhibition or fair with their stand three days ahead to the trade office at the place where its permanent establishment is located .
absurdity of 2009 was the obligation of physiotherapists to have a  |||  large  |||  mirror , a refrigerator and two stepping scales in the office .
new category recognizes socially  |||  responsible  |||  companies
|||  environmental  |||  , humanitarian , educational and sports projects are considered .
new in the fifth year of hn daily competition is the category called the  |||  responsible  |||  company in 2010 .
the mission of this competition is to promote reasonable and fair  |||  business  |||  .
" we want this to support companies that reflect their business " impact on the environment and encourage socially  |||  responsible  |||  activities , " says patrik bartholdy , regional manager of vodafone mobile operator company , which is the promoter and guarantor of the competition , as well as in the case of the rebel competition .
in the first year of this special subcategory of the main vodafone competition company of the year 2010 , companies , for whom success in  |||  business  |||  is not the only long - term goal , signed for the competition .
each story is very inspirational and would be enough for a  |||  separate  |||  article .
although the nature of their activities varies considerably , the common denominator of their efforts may be the  |||  support  |||  and thoughtfulness .
in one case , for example , it relates to people with disabilities and elsewhere to personal problems or  |||  health  |||  of their employees .
among the fourteen finalists in cr we find a prague - located software company et netera who supports the creation of informal sports teams of staff which then participate in a number of tournaments in  |||  different  |||  sports .
another example of a  |||  responsible  |||  company from the pardubice region is the company isolit - bravo , who has been a major contributor to the endowment fund for handicapped children for seventeen years .
old mill of podebrady then takes care of their disabled employees , who are more than 70 percent of the whole staff , and was thus awarded with the title of  |||  responsible  |||  company in the central bohemia region and won the third place in the vodafone competition company of the year .
in the olomouc region the award was received by miryz soft accounting firm , which has introduced flexible working hours in addition to the  |||  reduced  |||  average 35 hours per week but did not reduce salary proportionately .
the title was also awarded to the company because they preferably buy from czech manufacturers ,  |||  promote  |||  civic activities in the neighborhood and protect the environment .
" we try to recycle as much as possible so that our  |||  business  |||  and our administration had the least impact on the environment , " explains the executive miluse ryznarová .
responsible it company enlogit in the ústí region then thinks about the health of its employees , and for each laptop purchased they bought ergonomic chairs and keyboards , support their work from home and use catering services  |||  provided  |||  by a local sheltered workshop for their corporate events .
" in addition , we  |||  support  |||  the people in need foundation , which helps the local roma community in particular , " says company representative ondrej suchy .
finally , worth noting is also the activity of praní a čištění  |||  company  |||  of the karlovy vary region , which contributes its employees with bonuses to their pension schemes .
" we provide allowanced for meals , transport , upskilling and recreation , " says josef strapáč from bruntál czasch  |||  construction  |||  company , the winner in the moravia - silesian region .
incorrectly filled or incomplete answers to the questionnaire were then  |||  excluded  |||  from the evaluation by the organizer .
" if the representatives of competing companies failed to answer the questions , they could not attend the  |||  responsible  |||  company of the year competition , but are not disqualified from the " main " vodafone competition company of the year . "
in recent days the anti - corruption police made arrests at the  |||  building  |||  of the land fund in pilsen .
handcuffs were put by detectives to a local entrepreneur in the  |||  media  |||  sector and real estate dealer , luboš g.
he was supposed to pay half a  |||  million  |||  to luboš g.
so far i can only confirm that the police prosecute one person for the offense of fraudulent manipulation of public procurement and public tenders , " said the head of pilsner prosecution antonie zelená to pravo , adding that the additional details with  |||  respect  |||  to ongoing investigations can not be released .
due to a low of  |||  official  |||  information we can only speculate how one could manipulate the tender .
" it was a  |||  client  |||  , not our employee , " she said .
the public tender , according to ms. cerna , is called " invitation to tender for the  |||  transfer  |||  of land rights under the lands act " and takes place when more eligible candidates are interested in the land offered .
" these people within the  |||  call  |||  offer a higher value of their restitution claims to be settled by the transfer than the announced value of the land . "
mr luboš g. probably had information , who replied to the  |||  call  |||  , and since he is also a beneficiary , because he has bought a number of restitution claims , he suggested to another candidate not to participate .
that would explain that he was  |||  detained  |||  with such a large sum of money .
lubos g had superior contacts to lf already in the  |||  past  |||  .
he figured in the case of former chief of lf vaclav sankot , who was prosecuted for transferring lands in the substitutional land restitution , on which a decision on the location of a  |||  building  |||  has already been issued .
it was just then when mr lubos g. acquired lands intended for the construction of public roads from the fund , particularly at the point where the driveway was to be  |||  built  |||  to the industrial zone borska pole .
later , he very conveniently exchanged those with the city for a house in the  |||  historic  |||  town center , which had a much higher value .
town hall had to  |||  accept  |||  it then , because otherwise it would block the construction by blocking the lands .
households will pay extra  |||  hundreds  |||  for housing a month
households will have to pay more since january , not only for all types of  |||  energy  |||  , but also for water and sewerage , heating supplies , and rents will rise in certain areas .
families will have to pull out monthly  |||  hundreds  |||  more from purses from january .
prices of power energy were reduced by all the major suppliers at the same time ; a  |||  significant  |||  increase in support for the production of energy from renewable sources , especially photovoltaics , is to blame then .
although gas will only be slightly more expensive , it will happen when most people are heating their flats and  |||  thus  |||  have the highest consumption .
annually they must then also take  |||  extra  |||  costs in account .
while electricity and gas will be more expensive  |||  across  |||  the country , central heating price change varies from place to place .
price  |||  increase  |||  is planned mainly in larger municipalities .
for example , households in pardubice and hradec kralove will pay since january for central heating about czk 50 per month  |||  extra  |||  , families in liberec will pay extra czk 1,000 a year .
residents of prague may have more expensive water and sewer by more than 9 percent , in the event that the city  |||  increases  |||  the rent of the infrastructure .
|||  price  |||  in prague , however , will still be in a nationwide comparison rather low .
for example , the price of rent in 450 thousands of rental apartments , where regulation  |||  ends  |||  in january , may significantly increase .
for example , cpi byty , which in usti nad labem owns about 2,500 apartments , plans to raise the  |||  rent  |||  from january by up to one hundred percent .
the company intends to bring to the court those who will not  |||  accept  |||  the new rents .
regulated rents  |||  paid  |||  by people in approximately 300 thousand apartments could increase by up to ten percent next year .
fernet , rum , vodka , exceptionally better  |||  brand  |||  of whiskey stolen from parents .
these are the drinks , after which most often drunks not even of the age of fifteen end in physicians "  |||  care  |||  .
children who are  |||  treated  |||  for drunkenness at the hospital repeatedly are not an exception .
this follows the experience of physicians who are confronted with  |||  similar  |||  cases in the admissions of patients to children departments of hospitals .
" beer or wine is completely unfashionable , as it takes a long time  |||  before  |||  they get drunk . "
" liquor is the trend of today , that is for  |||  sure  |||  , " said the head of children 's ward in horovice hospital in central bohemia , ludek pelican to pravo .
" vodka has the  |||  advantage  |||  that it is served in juice and they may not smell so badly then , " said the head physician .
and this is confirmed by the  |||  speaker  |||  of the faculty hospital motol , eva jurinová .
" it is today a modern spirit , especially in  |||  primary  |||  schools . "
" in some cases , it was a plum brandy , which they have brought from  |||  home  |||  , " said jurinová .
according to the head physician pelikán are thirteen - or fourteen - year - old drinkers admitted to hospital a relatively  |||  common  |||  phenomenon .
before hořovice , where he has been since this year , he  |||  worked  |||  for ten years just in pediatrics department in motol , where ambulances bring befuddled schoolchildren from the surrounding area .
" she started her career at the age of twelve , when she was  |||  brought  |||  to us with a 3.5 per mille of alcohol in the blood , in addition in combination with ecstasy , " the doctor describes a particularly serious case .
" she had attended a dance  |||  party  |||  and vystaviste . "
" it is interesting that her  |||  mother  |||  did not find at all strange that she had not seen her daughter for 48 hours , " said the chief physician .
it is the disinterest of parents or even their considerable tolerance to drinking problems of their own offspring is considered a  |||  major  |||  cause of increasing children boozing .
it is however not an addiction in the  |||  true  |||  sense in the case of children according to experts .
according to spokeswoman jurinová about forty drunken  |||  children  |||  have this year been hospitalized at the pediatric clinic in motol until mid - november .
the statistics , however ,  |||  receive  |||  only those with severe intoxication who had to stay in the hospital .
child drunks , who are taken  |||  home  |||  after outpatient treatment by their parents or the police , are not counted .
except where kids just sit around after  |||  school  |||  and drink a bottle of brandy , according to pelikan , there are three seasonal fluctuations , which one can rely on : witch feast , new year and the end of the school year .
" but i  |||  experienced  |||  seven drunk children admitted to hospital at the same time during the witch feast " said pelikan .
morning headaches caused by dehydration and lack of glucose are prevented by irrigation infusion with glucose and nutrients that the  |||  body  |||  is lacking .
" they are actually doing better because they have the  |||  beautiful  |||  evening experience and a good wake up when nothing hurts . "
" sometimes i used this as an educational measure , when i directly to those children calculated how much it cost that they became drunk , and that they could also  |||  spend  |||  the summer working to make money to cover this one party , " said pelikan .
insurance companies , however , do not take regression procedures in which the parents should cover the cost of  |||  treatment  |||  in cases of child drunks .
two l - 159 aircrafts are in  |||  foreign  |||  hands for the first time in spain
two l - 159 of a total of five pieces for which the czech defense ministry has exchanged transport aircraft casa c - 295m , flew on tuesday to seville , where is  |||  based  |||  the manufacturer of casa aircrafts - eads .
it is the first time that aircrafts of this type appeared in the possession of someone  |||  else  |||  than the czech army .
it is a two - seat version of the l - 159t1 aircraft , which has been operated by  |||  czech  |||  army and were airworthy .
it has not been released when the aircrafts will physically leave vodochody , according to jan pejsek of the press department of ministry of  |||  defense  |||  .
" single - seat l - 159 have been  |||  allocated  |||  for the exchange from long - stored aircraft , and without any deposits and investments by the ministry . "
" two - seat l - 159t1 aircrafts were exchanged in the  |||  current  |||  condition and form , " pejsek told pravo .
he added that the army will not be left without a two - seat aircraft , because in may 2009 the ministry signed a contract  |||  worth  |||  200 million crowns with aero vodochody for the reconstruction of four redundant l - 159 machines into two two - seat machines .
" the contract clearly states that the purchaser of the l - 159 is the eads company and they will be used for  |||  training  |||  pilots from nato countries . "
" how to  |||  implement  |||  this thing is therefore an issue for customers " said pejsek .
hospodářské noviny recently reported that the  |||  spanish  |||  army is not interested in l - 159 .
the former leadership of ministry of defense argued that the exchange would  |||  promote  |||  further exports of l - 159 abroad .
|||  purchase  |||  of casa aircrafts will probably have judicial implications .
the european commission has sued the czech ministry of  |||  defence  |||  at the european court because the aircrafts were to be selected on the basis of a european tender and not addressing only one manufacturer .
the army has already acquired three casa aircrafts , the last one should arrive in  |||  prague  |||  , airport kbely , within a fortnight .
having index finger longer than ring finger indicates a  |||  lower  |||  risk of cancer
it is a surprising conclusion of a study  |||  published  |||  on wednesday by the british journal of cancer .
this may be related to the level of the  |||  male  |||  hormone testosterone .
" our results  |||  show  |||  that the relative finger length may serve as a simple test for prostate cancer risk , especially for a man up to 60 years , " said study 's co - author ros eeles , professor at the institute for cancer research at the university of warwick .
the finger could then  |||  help  |||  determine which men should undergo tests for prostate cancer , particularly in combination with genetic risk or other threatening factors such as family health burden , she said .
more than a half of the study participants had a shorter index finger on their  |||  right  |||  hand than their ring finger .
the same probability of prostate cancer applied to them as for 19 percent of those whose fingers were of  |||  equal  |||  length .
for those who have the index finger longer than ring finger this  |||  risk  |||  decreased by 33 percent , while for men up to their sixties it was even an 87 percent decline .
the ratio of the length of those two fingers - formed in the prenatal period - probably reflects  |||  different  |||  levels of sex hormones to which the child is exposed in the womb .
|||  less  |||  testosterone corresponds to a longer index finger .
|||  previous  |||  studies have shown that it is the testosterone that supports prostate cancer development .
czech republic , like most of europe , woke up  |||  covered  |||  in snow on thursday morning .

the most reliable means of  |||  transport  |||  is the subway .
trams run  |||  delayed  |||  between charles square and namesti miru .
also  |||  railways  |||  and airports must are facing the problems .
|||  czech  |||  railways have had to cancel seven fast train connections due to snow .
there are problems with the railway line from  |||  prague  |||  to kralupy or from prague to beroun .
passengers should check the  |||  current  |||  situation .
ruzyne airport was  |||  closed  |||  from 11 pm wednesday night to 5 a.m. .
most of the roads in southern moravia are now passable , but only with  |||  caution  |||  .
there are three impassable side roads in the vyškov area , there is loads of snow in the brno area and snow chains are  |||  necessary  |||  for travelling on certain communications in higher parts of blansko region .
the most  |||  affected  |||  sites included the vyskov area .
there are  |||  closed  |||  roads still : rousínov - slavkov , bohdalice - kučerov and also šaratice - milešovice .
it is impossible to  |||  estimate  |||  when they will be passable again .
in the hodonin area , caution is  |||  necessary  |||  when travelling in the white carpathians .
on roads that are there in order to protect the environment just  |||  kept  |||  passable with inert fill , there is a 5 - centimeter layer of snow , said čtk .

|||  american  |||  troops have a new " smart weapon "
the u.s. army deployed a new " smart weapon " in afghanistan ,  |||  known  |||  so far only by a codename xm - 25 .
the generals hope that the new automatic rifle will affect the conflict with the taliban and "  |||  change  |||  the game " in their favor .
the new weapon is like a superaccurate  |||  small  |||  cannon .
their projectile is directed by a laser to hit within a few  |||  meters  |||  .
special ammunition caliber 25 mm , designed for this rifle and containing high explosive , in fact , act like  |||  little  |||  grenades .
the projectiles can be programmed to explode when hitting the target , but at any  |||  point  |||  of their ballistic path .
they can be used against an enemy who is hiding behind a  |||  barrier  |||  , behind walls or in trenches .
these are usually not  |||  protected  |||  from the above , and if hit by the rain of deadly shards of steel , they may not fight any more .
according to richard audetta who participated in the  |||  development  |||  of xm - 25 rifle , it is a new first weapon for the infantry , which uses " smart " technology .
" the soldier basically operates it as follows : they find a target , it sends a laser beam to determine the distance and thus the precise explanation of the  |||  point  |||  , they adjust the elevation and squeeze the trigger . "
" let 's say that you have obtained 543  |||  meters  |||  . "
" when you squeeze the trigger , the gun charges , and fires a missile at a  |||  distance  |||  of 543 meters plus or minus one , two or three meters , " said audette .
400  |||  jobs  |||  relocated
the fujitsu corporation is relocating its bad homburg office to  |||  frankfurt  |||  .
the  |||  japanese  |||  fujitsu corporation is relocating its bad homburg office to frankfurt .
the rental  |||  offer  |||  had been extremely attractive and the open - plan office in the astro park was better suited to the way employees actually work , the spokeswoman added .
the excellent connection to the airport was of particular significance to a  |||  global  |||  company such as fujitsu , he added .
markus frank ( cdu ) , head of frankfurt 's department of  |||  economic  |||  affairs , said the city had once again attracted a global player ,
he believed the city would suit fujitsu and that the move would be a  |||  significant  |||  boost for niederrad .
michael korwisi ( greens ) ,  |||  mayor  |||  of bad homburg , expressed his regret at fujitsu 's decision .
" we  |||  offered  |||  the company our help , as a matter of course , " said korwisi .
|||  economic  |||  reasons had finally tipped the balance .
korwisi now wants to focus on preventing such a prominent  |||  location  |||  from remaining vacant long - term .
" i hope the building 's  |||  owner  |||  and landlord will cooperate . "
in 2001 , three companies moved in : feri , the investment consultancy management and rating company , start amadeus , the travel sales and marketing systems software manufacturer , and fujitsu , the computer maker ( still  |||  linked  |||  to siemens at the time ) .
the buildings used by fujitsu were purchased in 2006 by the frankfurt - based dic group and the morgan stanley real estate fund and  |||  sold  |||  on to spanish falcon real estate investments sa in madrid one year later .
it provides companies with computers , servers and other equipment and provides  |||  necessary  |||  servicing .
7000  |||  square  |||  metres have been rented in the astro park office building to accommodate them .
the twenty - year - old complex - its name inspired by the star - shaped ground plan - is already  |||  home  |||  to the central association of the german electrical and electronics industry ( zvei ) and other organisations .
amazon blocks server -  |||  threats  |||  against assange
wikileaks is  |||  getting  |||  into deeper and deeper waters .
political pressure may stand behind the move following publication of hundreds of thousands of  |||  secret  |||  diplomatic dispatches .
the whistle blowing website , wikileaks , is increasingly under fire in the  |||  united  |||  states .
internet activists have lost access to their american server and are now looking for an internet  |||  home  |||  in europe .
the prominent  |||  american  |||  senator joe lieberman called upon other countries and companies to boycott wikileaks .
in the meantime , a newspaper report suggests wikileaks founder julian assange , who is on interpol 's wanted list , is currently in great  |||  britain  |||  .
"  |||  free  |||  speech in the land of the free , " said the whistle blowing activists on wednesday ( local time ) via the twitter messaging service .
a short while previously , the internet  |||  company  |||  amazon had banned wikileaks documents from its servers .
the internet activists had used the amazon web service ( aws ) to publish secret diplomatic dispatches in order to be able to cope with the  |||  high  |||  number of people accessing the documents .
wikileaks discussed the step on twitter : " great - we 'll  |||  spend  |||  our dollars employing people in europe instead . "
if amazon had  |||  issues  |||  with freedom of speech , " it should give up selling books . "
amazon stopped wikileaks  |||  using  |||  its servers after colleagues of senator joe lieberman started to investigate , reported the broadcaster cnn , quoting lieberman 's office .
the chairman of the senate committee on homeland security and governmental affairs had threatened to boycott amazon ,  |||  reported  |||  the british newspaper " the guardian . "
" i would have liked to see amazon take this step  |||  earlier  |||  , considering the previous publication of classified information by wikileaks , " said the senator .
lieberman also called on other countries to cooperate in  |||  preventing  |||  wikileaks from finding new servers .
" no  |||  responsible  |||  company - whether american or foreign - should assist wikileaks in its efforts to disseminate these stolen materials . "
wikileaks founder assange , who is wanted by swedish  |||  authority  |||  on suspicion of rape , is on interpol 's wanted list .
according to a report in the london - based newspaper " the independent , " the 39 - year - old australian is currently in the uk , and scotland yard is aware of his exact  |||  location  |||  .
in london , wikileaks spokesman kristinn hrafnsson said that  |||  threats  |||  had been made .
" there have even been  |||  calls  |||  to assassinate julian assange . "
hrafnsson said that assange was therefore  |||  afraid  |||  for his personal safety .
the wikileaks  |||  founder  |||  will remain in hiding .
hrafnsson was clearly reacting to statements from north  |||  america  |||  .
in america , the former republican governor of arkansas , mike huckabee , had called for the people  |||  responsible  |||  for the wikileaks revelations to be indicted and executed for treason .
in the meantime , exchanges have been made between the white  |||  house  |||  and assange .
robert gibbs , the speaker of american president barack obama , said that it was " ridiculous and absurd " that assange had demanded the resignation of secretary of state hillary clinton if she is found  |||  responsible  |||  for recently revealed requests to diplomats to engage in espionage .
" i 'm not entirely sure why we care about the  |||  opinion  |||  of a guy with a website , " said gibbs .
" our foreign policy and the interests of this country are far stronger than his one  |||  website  |||  . "
the american  |||  government  |||  is currently carrying out a comprehensive review of the security of its databases .
russell travers , deputy director of the information division at the national anti - terrorism centre , has been appointed as a special representative , the white  |||  house  |||  announced .
travers will be  |||  responsible  |||  for developing the " necessary structural reforms " that are now needed following the disclosure of diplomatic dispatches by wikileaks .
the white house also wants to  |||  look  |||  at how the entire government exchanges and protects information .
the  |||  american  |||  government also expressed its concern for the safety of dissidents and activists who may be put at risk by the wikileaks publication .
" we have done everything to  |||  contact  |||  them , " said states department spokesman philip crowley .
" we are ready to protect them if that becomes  |||  necessary  |||  . "
the ice cream  |||  university  |||
ice cream confectioners are being trained for the warm seasons at the " gelato  |||  university  |||  " in bologna .
the three - day foundation course for future " gelatieri " is the largest course , and welcomes visitors from all over the  |||  world  |||  .
where does all that ice cream  |||  actually  |||  come from ?
but for anyone who wants to know more about ice cream , the " gelato  |||  university  |||  " of the italian carpigiani company is a must .
the ice cream  |||  university  |||  was created by the manufacturer of ice cream makers in 2003 to ensure that the ice cream from all its makers met exacting italian standards .
the three - day foundation course for future " gelatieri " is the largest course , and welcomes visitors from all over the  |||  world  |||  .
many dream of a new career to escape a mid - life crisis ; others come to test their vague  |||  aspirations  |||  against the cold facts .
jacky , an art teacher from california , loves the slow food movement and wants to  |||  offer  |||  a high - quality european product in a country accustomed to industrial ice cream .
one man from malta and another from brazil want to improve the quality of the ice cream in their bars - and canadian housewife julia has come because her children love  |||  italian  |||  ice cream .
maestro gelatiere luciano ferrari begins the course by describing the ideal characteristics of a  |||  perfect  |||  ice cream .
the first step of production  |||  seems  |||  very easy .
luciano pours the basic  |||  ingredients  |||  - milk , cream , powdered milk , sugar and stabilisers - into a large blender that heats the mixture to 85 degrees on an electronic programme and then immediately cools it to four degrees .
then he turns a tap on the  |||  machine  |||  and out comes a pasteurised , basic white ice cream , the basic for all milk - based ice creams .
the lecturer is immediately overwhelmed by questions . can you make ice cream using  |||  natural  |||  ingredients only without stabilisers ?
how can you  |||  experiment  |||  freely on your own ?
anyone who talks about making ice cream " using  |||  natural  |||  ingredients only " has probably used stabilisers anyway - in most cases a natural product such as guar gum from guar beans .
of course , you can make ice cream without stabilisers , but then you have to sell it within a day , as otherwise it collapses and your  |||  customer  |||  ends up licking lumps of ice .
for ice cream flavouring , maestro luciano differentiates between the ingredients you buy in the fruit  |||  section  |||  and in the sweet section of the supermarket .
" all  |||  suppliers  |||  will try to get you to get you to buy dozens of flavoured additives .
but you should just  |||  experiment  |||  . "
at last the course participants are  |||  allowed  |||  onto the ice cream maker .
luciano lets each of them make four  |||  different  |||  types of vanilla , chocolate , mocha and hazelnut ice cream - with or without eggs in the base and with more or less vanilla flavouring or other natural ingredients .
the team that produces the most popular kiwi ice cream uses more fruit , less  |||  water  |||  and a little less of the stabiliser .
the taste of a gelato only really stands out if the mixture is  |||  balanced  |||  , says luciano .
making ice cream is a matter of arithmetic . if sugary peach purée is used , the proportion of sugar in the basic recipe has to be  |||  reduced  |||  .
an  |||  extra  |||  portion of sugar is needed for lemon ice cream .
luciano brings out a device that shows him the sugar content of the types of  |||  fruit  |||  ( vintners use it to measure the density of grape must using the oechsle scale ) .
fortunately ,  |||  tables  |||  make the calculations easier .
there is also a device that beats the finished ice cream mixture to a creamy consistency while cooling it to negative  |||  temperatures  |||  .
" in every course , " says maestro luciano , " it is only a  |||  matter  |||  of time before something like this happens . "
there are allegations that the european food safety  |||  authority  |||  ( efsa ) has been infiltrated by the genetically modified crop industry .
" it sounds like a conspiracy theory , but we have good documentary evidence , " said  |||  head  |||  of testbiotech , christoph then , in munich on wednesday .
harry kuiper , chair of efsa 's  |||  expert  |||  panel responsible for the risk assessment of genetically engineered plants and another efsa expert are also believed to have been working with the lobby group ilsi for years .
kuiper has had a central role in developing the efsa test specifications for gm plants and therefore has a  |||  clear  |||  conflict of interests , says then .
in places , the efsa regulations are identical to position papers produced by ilsi and thus are being written by the very industry that the  |||  authority  |||  , based in the italian city of parma , should be controlling , argues then ,
pointing out that this is the second time testbiotech has criticised a  |||  conflict  |||  of interests .
mdr radio has also recently uncovered personal connections between the eu supervisory  |||  authority  |||  and the industry lobby , which has caught the attention of the environment agency and eu parliamentarians .
in a statement , efsa said that all significant data were considered , including data from industry , if such data were of a high  |||  professional  |||  quality .
in addition , efsa stated that it had no requirement that its panels avoid all  |||  contact  |||  with industry .
kuiper admits to  |||  working  |||  for the international life sciences institute ( ilsi ) in the usa .
the institute describes  |||  itself  |||  as a neutral forum for experts from science , industry and politics to assess the risks around biotechnology and other areas - without a lobbying mandate .
|||  current  |||  practice is only to test isolated proteins , but not the entire gm plant , which does not provide reliable results .
" if you do n't look for the  |||  risks  |||  , how are you supposed to find them ? , " asks then .
the scientist has been carrying out research into gm technology since 1994 and is currently  |||  working  |||  at eth zurich .
the industry is increasingly trying to influence or discredit outspokenly  |||  critical  |||  scientists in this field in europe , as in the usa , says hilbeck .
there are hardly any  |||  researchers  |||  left without ties to corporations , she believes ,
and studies criticising  |||  companies  |||  are not normally published .

" these  |||  stones  |||  are relics . "
he raves : " a cheap and  |||  poor  |||  stone , simple and earthy . "
|||  stones  |||  have plenty of time .
the 44 - year - old  |||  trades  |||  in old stones .
he has bought  |||  every  |||  stone from the demolition in stuttgart .
" it would be a crime if they were ground into gravel or disappeared into landfill , " he says in his office , a small wooden shack that was  |||  once  |||  a sentry box .
he talked with the  |||  opponents  |||  of the stuttgart 21 development project for days on end .
some as a keepsake , but others in the hope of being able to  |||  return  |||  the blocks if the building is rebuilt .

about half is stored in the forest , but the rest has been  |||  sold  |||  long ago .
gardeners , landscape gardeners and  |||  homeowners  |||  .
" actually , this  |||  stone  |||  is nothing special , " says rongen .
" if it did n't have  |||  political  |||  significance . "
he studied law but switched to biology , then he got  |||  interested  |||  in computers , and finally became a stone merchant .
he carts his treasure from all over  |||  germany  |||  .
artfully carved sandstones are lying in the  |||  snow  |||  .
elbe sandstone , yellow and  |||  warm  |||  , he says .
" my favourite  |||  stone  |||  . "
he  |||  points  |||  to a pile : red sandstone , previously part of karlsruhe train station .
the blocks  |||  once  |||  belonged to the stands of stuttgart 's neckar stadium .
the snow is full of stones and stories - stuttgart travertine from stuttgart  |||  police  |||  headquarters , red granite from dom st. blasius , tuff from heilbrunn hospital .
" it would be a  |||  scandal  |||  to shred all this . "
he has n't become  |||  rich  |||  , but he has found some priceless stones .
" we work  |||  hard  |||  , but it is satisfying , " says the used stone dealer .
he has to go to cologne  |||  soon  |||  .
there are  |||  stones  |||  to be rescued there as well .
16  |||  students  |||  are shoving their way to salmon rolls , tomato soup and desert .
the technical university of braunschweig and the car maker volkswagen have  |||  invited  |||  mechanical engineering and design students to a workshop .
they are going  |||  talk  |||  shop on the car of the future with vw developers in a kind of idea contest - and , incidentally , find out more about volkswagen .
many  |||  companies  |||  are already engaged in hand - to - hand combat in the contest for the cleverest minds , and are relying on cooperation with universities , just like vw .
and because universities do not provide a breakdown of student performance , companies are looking for and hoping to attract  |||  exceptional  |||  talent in hands - on projects .
she tells the young hopefuls about internships and student  |||  jobs  |||  , and explains the various routes into the company .
nico selle from the technical university of braunschweig is managing the  |||  project  |||  with vw .
he sees advantages for both sides . " the students get in  |||  contact  |||  with industry and gain some experience . "
what is new is that  |||  students  |||  are being touted so aggressively .
the  |||  fight  |||  for the latest batch of graduates is set to be a lot tougher .
in many sectors ,  |||  companies  |||  can no longer identify their employees from the hoards of applicants .
graduates in  |||  engineering  |||  find themselves particularly well placed for negotiation .
according to the association of  |||  german  |||  engineers ( vdi ) , more than 40,000 engineering jobs were unfilled in october .
roman dykta is on the hunt for talent for kpmg , the audit , tax and advisory services  |||  firm  |||  .
the company wants to send eight promising students straight across the usa  |||  next  |||  year .
and quite incidentally , the participants will see kpmg branches and get to know the  |||  company  |||  .
who gets to go is  |||  decided  |||  in two advance selection rounds .
amidst all the war cries surrounding  |||  university  |||  graduates with potential , the rifle shots from some companies are getting louder and louder , says dykta .
for  |||  talent  |||  - hunter dykta , the sums add up .
" to this day , we have stayed in contact with all the participants of a  |||  similar  |||  campaign last year . "
besides  |||  direct  |||  touting on campus , small and medium - sized businesses especially are stalking candidates at classic career fairs .
" for example , at intersolar , " says sitha stübe ,  |||  head  |||  of human resources at the solar technology manufacturer , solarworld .
the bonn - based company employs  |||  around  |||  1500 people in germany .
there are currently 35 vacancies on the company  |||  website  |||  .
" it is really very  |||  difficult  |||  to fill vacant positions . "
" it  |||  costs  |||  a lot of time and money , " she says .
solarworld is  |||  cooperating  |||  with a number of universities , including freiberg university .
" the lecturers point out that the students can do internships or  |||  write  |||  their dissertations with us . "
expensive  |||  advertising  |||  campaigns for solar specialists are not in the pipeline .
on the other hand , the company is trying to advertise with its other advantages , including a relaxed working atmosphere , flat hierarchies and straightforward  |||  communication  |||  .
" a big corporation cannot often  |||  offer  |||  that , " says human resources manager stübe .
|||  money  |||  has not been the key factor in the job market for a while .
flexible  |||  working  |||  time , childcare and good promotion opportunities are also decisive factors .
solarworld came in 55th place among the 100  |||  best  |||  employers in germany in a study by the great place to work institute .
the institute publishes an annual league table of  |||  german  |||  employers .
wolf reiner kriegler from the  |||  german  |||  employer branding academy is an advisor for companies seeking to develop a reputation as a good employer as part of a long - term strategy .

" the best way to make yourself attractive as an employer is via your own  |||  employees  |||  , " he says .
"  |||  happy  |||  employees are the best ambassadors . "
if you treat your own well and they  |||  identify  |||  with the company , then they will find you new employees among their friends and acquaintances .

there will be no new drilling off the coast of the us federal  |||  state  |||  of florida in the gulf of mexico in the coming year .
the government in washington has published a prohibition to that effect - thereby definitively scrapping  |||  earlier  |||  plans .
the explosion of the deepwater horizon drilling platform in april was the trigger for the  |||  strict  |||  prohibition , which is to remain in force for at least the next five years .
before the disaster that cost eleven workers their lives and led to the usa 's biggest environmental disaster , president barack obama , under pressure from the opposition and industry , had signalled his readiness to  |||  allow  |||  new drilling in the eastern area of the gulf of mexico .
advocators had hoped this would  |||  reduce  |||  the usa 's dependency on foreign oil supplies .
who will  |||  bear  |||  responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the gulf has still not been conclusively decided .
the  |||  british  |||  energy company bp is the focus of criticism , and is faced with claims for billions of dollars .
in october ,  |||  secretary  |||  of the interior ken salazar had revoked the prohibition on drilling imposed after the explosion .
in response ,  |||  various  |||  oil companies immediately submitted applications for new drilling projects .
obama and salazar want to rule out any further catastrophe with tougher controls and stricter safety  |||  regulations  |||  .
the responsible control authority , which fell into disrepute after  |||  numerous  |||  accusations of corruption , is being extensively reformed .
" the government 's plans are the biggest brake on the growth of the oil and gas industry , " is the outcome of a recent industry survey by the consultancy  |||  firm  |||  bdo - even before the prohibition on drilling was put in place on wednesday .
the  |||  american  |||  energy alliance also complains of the uncertainty faced by the industry . " no one knows what exactly will change in terms of regulation . "
the  |||  water  |||  in the rivers is oil - brown and reeks like a petrol station . billions of litres of leaked crude oil have destroyed the natural environment of ogoniland in nigeria .
people are  |||  living  |||  on theft , corruption and cooking illegal oil .
the 37 - year - old nigerian was  |||  trying  |||  to photograph a boy wading up to his waist in the water - and the streaks of water around him . in the rainbow - coloured water , the scene is almost beautiful .
esther badom used to fill buckets with shrimps at the  |||  bank  |||  of the bodo jetty river .
five years ago ,  |||  massive  |||  quantities of crude oil flooded out of a burst oil pipeline into the vast wetland .
fishermen from the nearby town of bodo now have to paddle six hours to get to water inhabited by fish . ogoniland , in the  |||  heart  |||  of the niger delta , is one of the most contaminated regions in the world .
on the journey through the mangrove swamps , criss - crossed by river courses , the  |||  full  |||  extent of the devastation is plain to see .
instead of clear water , the motorboat churns up a brown swill ; if you put your hand in the  |||  water  |||  it comes out coated in oil .
the roots of the mangrove trees stick out from the ground like  |||  black  |||  liquorice sticks . the odd palm among the mangroves hangs its frond despondently .
" what is happening here is ecological warfare , " says celestine akpobari , sombrely . " we are living with a  |||  permanent  |||  hazard to health . "
the region of the ogoni has been a contested battlefield for decades . more than 60 years ago , the first explorers from europe made their way to the region . in the 80s , the first wave of resistance was organised around the author ken saro - wiwa , who was later executed . it was here that the shell company had to  |||  stop  |||  production in 1993 , because it was too dangerous for its oil workers .
even today , the company is prohibited from returning to ogoniland . while more than two million barrels of black gold are pumped every day from the delta region as a  |||  whole  |||  - which is an area three times the size of switzerland with more than 5000 wells and 7000 kilometres of pipeline - the oilfields in ogoniland lie fallow , the situation too unstable for the oil company .
these structures can be up to 50  |||  years  |||  old and most of them are seriously corroded .
one borehole after the next falls apart , says akpobari , then a  |||  constant  |||  stream of crude oil runs into the water .
according to expert estimates , more than two billion litres have flown into the delta 's ecosystem in 50 years . year on year , that is the same  |||  amount  |||  of oil that rushed into the sea off alaska when the exxon valdez supertanker crashed 21 years ago - one of the largest environmental catastrophes in human history .
there is dispute over who should be held  |||  responsible  |||  for the ongoing worst case scenario of ecological disaster .
in 2008 , the us academic richard steiner accused shell of applying significantly lower safety standards in nigeria than in the rest of the world . the rate of defects in pipelines  |||  alone  |||  was " several times higher than elsewhere . "
human figures emerge from the mangrove swamps , that from a distance  |||  look  |||  deserted , oil - covered outside garages . the figures are stark naked and covered to the neck in oil .
under one of the many barrels - some  |||  connected  |||  to pipes , others scattered at random over the ground - there is a a flickering fire . an illegal mini refinery .
michael , the group  |||  leader  |||  , explains that the crude oil is heated in the barrel for several hours .
first , benzine is siphoned off to a collecting pan , then kerosene drips from the end of the tube and finally ,  |||  diesel  |||  .
michael and four assistants  |||  produce  |||  up to four 300 - litre barrels of diesel a day in this way . " we get 34,000 naira for it " - about 22 dollars .
the inhabitants of the delta use the chronic  |||  fuel  |||  shortage to their advantage in the largest crude oil state of sub - saharan africa .
the  |||  illegal  |||  cooks can still undercut the absurdly low diesel prices of 40 euro cents per litre . they get their raw material for nothing .
however , only a tiny proportion of the raw material stored by bunkerers goes on to be refined illegally .  |||  organised  |||  criminal networks with politicians and high - ranking officers amongst their ranks fill tankers with the lion 's share and flog it on the global market .
" if the oil companies were not perceived as interlopers and if they had not so thoroughly destroyed the fishermen 's livelihood , there would not be any sabotage , theft or  |||  illegal  |||  refineries . "
akpobari explains that the relationship between the ogoni towards shell in particular has been destroyed to such an extent that only withdrawal by the company is an option . " perhaps other nations such as the  |||  chinese  |||  will prove to be a better option . "
|||  michael  |||  turns edgy .
" it 's time you disappear , "  |||  says  |||  the muscular oil man .
" the  |||  soldiers  |||  might turn up at any minute . "
it seems that the soldiers , who mainly originate from the north of the country , also want to  |||  profit  |||  from oil , like all other nigerians .
" this damned stuff has brought our country to rock bottom in  |||  every  |||  way , " says akpobari .
investigators uncover  |||  dangerous  |||  defect in a 380 engines
the a 380 , it  |||  seems  |||  , has a major safety issue .
the airline qantas is now preparing to take the  |||  engine  |||  manufacturer to court .
the passengers of the qantas airbus that was forced to land at the beginning of november appear to have had considerably more luck than anyone realised . during its investigations , the australian air safety authority  |||  identified  |||  a serious safety issue in the engines of some a 380 planes - and is now warning of a possible construction defect .
the alleged defect would have serious consequences . in a statement published on thursday , the australian transport safety  |||  bureau  |||  ( atsb ) revealed that the defect could potentially cause fatigue cracks and leaks in an oil hose connection .
this could  |||  lead  |||  to " catastrophic engine failure . "
the qantas airbus that was forced to land in  |||  singapore  |||  on 4 november was one of those aeroplanes .
the australian airline is now taking legal steps against the  |||  british  |||  turbine manufacturer .
the ceo of qantas , alan joyce , said that his airline would  |||  demand  |||  compensation for the incident which occurred at the beginning of november .
the heat of the engine had caused parts to become detached and had  |||  damaged  |||  the wings .
following the incident , up to 40 engines  |||  around  |||  the world must now be replaced .
the australian investigators  |||  announced  |||  that they will be carrying out further safety tests on the superjumbos fitted with the affected engines .
atsb speaker martin dolan said that the safety recommendation was the  |||  result  |||  of cooperation with rolls - royce .
the safety issue was  |||  considered  |||  sufficiently serious for all affected parties to be informed .
after the forced landing of the qantas plane , the airline grounded its a 380  |||  fleet  |||  for weeks .
the double - decker is the largest passenger plane in the  |||  world  |||  .
country - wide snowfall unleashes  |||  traffic  |||  chaos
germany all in white . there has been overnight snowfall  |||  across  |||  most of the country .
at least  |||  three  |||  people have died in car accidents .
in the  |||  north  |||  and east of the country , there is 15 centimetres of snow in some areas .
traffic is severely  |||  restricted  |||  on many motorways and roads .
|||  strong  |||  winds were also recorded over the baltic coast .
the federal maritime and hydrographic agency ( bsh ) is expecting storm tides with water levels 1.2 metres above  |||  normal  |||  on the baltic coast of schleswig - holstein from the morning onwards .
in saxony , the snow drifts on motorways and a -  |||  roads  |||  have been causing serious problems .
30 centimetres of fresh snow fell in some parts of the region and fresh strong winds  |||  caused  |||  drifts .
a  |||  number  |||  of lorries and cars were stranded during the night .
in saxony - anhalt , the police authorities also reported  |||  serious  |||  disruption on the roads .
snow and wind  |||  caused  |||  crawling traffic and traffic jams on the a 2 .
according to deutsche bahn , there are  |||  significant  |||  disruptions in saxony , saxony - anhalt , thuringia and in the north of bavaria .
in saxony , long - distance trains from leipzig to nuremberg had to be  |||  stopped  |||  .
an ice train to  |||  munich  |||  was forced to end its journey in saalfeld , thuringia .
snow swept across the  |||  roads  |||  .
snow and wind is causing numerous cancellations at  |||  major  |||  german airports .
in  |||  frankfurt  |||  am main , a spokeswoman for fraport said that 40 flights had already been axed .
only a small number of stranded passengers were at the  |||  airport  |||  , and there were just under 400 camp beds still available to accommodate them , said the spokeswoman .
accidents had already occurred on many  |||  roads  |||  by wednesday evening .
one lorry driver  |||  died  |||  in the evening in a collision with a train on a level crossing in ostholstein .
a  |||  similar  |||  accident occurred near nuremberg on snow - covered roads . a truck was stranded on a level crossing when the vehicle got stuck in the snow .
the  |||  driver  |||  died .
four passengers in the  |||  train  |||  were injured - the line from bayreuth to nuremberg was closed into the hours of the morning .
there is , however , some good news from forecasters . although the snow will continue to be loose and powdery causing snow drifts even in  |||  light  |||  winds ,
only the baltic sea will suffer  |||  strong  |||  and stormy winds .
however , it will remain very cold - up to minus 15  |||  degrees  |||  in some places .
deutsche bank  |||  seeking  |||  buyer for its twin towers
deutsche bank wants to sell its emblem . according to a newspaper report , the bank is  |||  looking  |||  for buyers for the two office high - rises at its frankfurt headquarters .
the  |||  property  |||  could fetch up to 500 million euros .
but the financial institution now clearly wants to recoup the costs of renovation - and is  |||  looking  |||  for a buyer for the two high - rises , writes financial times germany , quoting a spokesman .
the spokesman did not indicate the reasons for the planned  |||  sale  |||  .
" we are constantly reviewing whether it is better to own property ourselves or to sell it and then rent it  |||  back  |||  , " he said .
according to the information available , the extensive renovation cost around 200 million  |||  euros  |||  .
a sale would earn the  |||  bank  |||  a lot of money .
according to the newspaper , industry experts estimate the value of the towers , renamed the " greentowers , " at  |||  around  |||  500 million euros .
it has not yet been possible to recover the bodies , as the safety situation in the shaft where the accident happened  |||  remains  |||  precarious .
almost two weeks ago , a violent explosion  |||  occurred  |||  in the pike river mine near the city of greymouth .
owing to the  |||  high  |||  concentration of poisonous gases and further subsequent explosions , no rescuers were allowed into the shaft for safety reasons .
in bright sunshine , ten thousand people gathered in greymouth on new zealand 's  |||  south  |||  island .
they held a two -  |||  minute  |||  silence .
29  |||  tables  |||  were set up in honour of the buried miners , displaying helmets , lamps and their names .
pictures and personal items , including  |||  clothing  |||  and surfboards , were also on display .
the flags were flying at half mast at all  |||  government  |||  buildings in the country .
new zealand had hoped that the miners would come  |||  back  |||  " from the depths of the earth " to the surface , said the prime minister of new zeeland john key to the crowds at the memorial .
" but they never came  |||  home  |||  . "
lawrie drew , father of trapped coal miner zen drew , said that he could not come to terms with the death of his son  |||  until  |||  he had seen his body .
several foreign diplomats took part in the memorial service alongside the  |||  prime minister  |||  and members of victims " families .
|||  british  |||  and south african miners were also buried alive in the first explosion on 19 november .
rescuers began by extinguishing a fire inside the coal  |||  mine  |||  on new zealand 's south island .
superintendent gary knowles told journalists that work would begin to cool the fierce temperatures inside the  |||  mine  |||  as soon as the explosive gases had been displaced .
to  |||  hell  |||  , warriors !
the film director  |||  nicolas  |||  winding refn is testing old genre boundaries afresh with his warrior epic " walhalla rising . "
a captured viking warrior with only one eye ( mads mikkelsen ) escapes his tormentors and knocks down his opponents with almost superhuman powers - which sounds ideal for young male viewers on the search for gore and  |||  action  |||  , particularly as our hero has a preference for brutal killing methods and is not averse to tearing out the entrails from the living bodies of his enemies when he is in a bad mood .
on the other hand , one - eye , as he is actually called , does not say a word during the  |||  entire  |||  film , and even the other figures are only induced to say one or two sentences at most , or to emit a few excruciating death cries .
otherwise , the film is silent , luxuriating in the eerily beautiful hills of scotland that  |||  provides  |||  the scenery for the viking world of around a thousand years ago .
more suited to adult cinema enthusiasts with an  |||  interest  |||  in existentialism and very smooth tracking shots .
great when a film has several target groups , but a shame if they are mutually  |||  exclusive  |||  .
since his wild and stylised  |||  drug  |||  dealer trilogy " pusher , " director winding refn has been seen as a kind of danish version of quentin tarantino , but stoically refuses to make his works accessible to the mainstream by using a little more humour or to the art house by displaying less brutality .
most art cinema enthusiasts would be deterred by the cerebral matter and entrails flying  |||  around  |||  .
if they have not already done so ,  |||  action  |||  fans will die of boredom when one - eye - for somewhat indecipherable reasons - sets off by ship to jerusalem with a troop of violent christian missionaries , ending up stuck for what seems like an eternity in dead calms and fog before the crew arrives in what is clearly america - where the silence continues .
this film is not about dialogue or a stringent plot , but all about  |||  atmosphere  |||  - a feverish dream that has become a film .
refn hardly allows the viewer a single  |||  moment  |||  of relaxation and slowly chokes the same view with his iron images and the gloomy trance - like soundtrack - and the incomprehensible hatred that strikes out at the viewer from the hearts of the characters .
only one small blond boy who stands faithfully at one - eye 's side retains  |||  anything  |||  of innocence - all other characters are driven by fury .
above all , it is the one - eyed hero who is driven by fury - whose motives are never explained , but who at some point becomes the warrior from hell for his enemies and  |||  temporary  |||  allies alike , and perhaps even the messenger of the devil himself .
he equals damnation , but  |||  perhaps  |||  only for the already damned .
the international atomic  |||  energy  |||  agency ( iaea ) has new evidence of a secret nuclear programme in syria .
towards midnight on the night of 5th to 6th september 2007 , at least four israeli f - 15 i fighter jets attacked a mysterious , cube - shaped  |||  building  |||  in syria .
it stands on the banks of the euphrates river ; the next  |||  major  |||  city , 30 kilometres away , is dair alzour .
according to a briefing from the us foreign intelligence service , the cia , at the end of april 2008 , the reactor , commonly referred to by the name of the nearest settlement el kibar , could be used to produce plutonium - which could in turn be used to  |||  build  |||  atomic bombs .
the  |||  technology  |||  from the fifties is of very little use for any other purpose .
|||  using  |||  computer animation , the agency showed where the components of the reactor are believed to have been located before its destruction - the reactor is said to be a smaller copy of the north korean model from the atomic centre in yongbyon .
now , more than three years after the bombardment , almost no more is known . in fact , the questions seem to have  |||  increased  |||  with time .
they  |||  lack  |||  hard evidence , as does the iaea .
asked how  |||  certain  |||  he is that a reactor exists this summer , a high - ranking un diplomat replied laconically that the iaea had " enough material to pose questions . "
the syrians , in any case , rapidly removed the rubble of the supposedly " unused military  |||  building  |||  " and levelled the area completely .
nonetheless , in june 2008 , an iaea  |||  team  |||  led by chief inspector olli heinonen discovered traces of man - made uranium in el kibar .
however , the images were not available on the market , as the  |||  unknown  |||  customer - israel , perhaps - has purchased them exclusively .
syria has claimed never to have had a  |||  secret  |||  atomic programme or to have built a reactor .
damascus claims the uranium was from israeli  |||  weapons  |||  .
however , after  |||  analysing  |||  the particles , the iaea rejected the claim as implausible .
since then , damascus has avoided discussion on this point - or on the  |||  satellite  |||  images .
syria has also prevented inspectors carrying out a second inspection in el kibar or to access the rubble of the bombed  |||  building  |||  .
israel is also maintaining a stony  |||  silence  |||  .
so the investigation has continued since june 2008 without conclusion and " is increasingly developing into a  |||  serious  |||  credibility problem for the authority , " according to a high - ranking western diplomat at the iaea headquarters in vienna - ultimately , a serious infringement of the non - proliferation treaty remains unresolved in the hands of the iaea .
the iaea clearly believes the key to moving forward in this process lies in three  |||  additional  |||  facilities that are supposed to have had a " functional connection " with the alleged reactor - and in contrast to the reactor , still exist .
however , inspectors have not so far disclosed the nature of the facilities or what  |||  function  |||  they have or what makes them seem suspicious .
according to information provided by the süddeutsche zeitung , they are  |||  referred  |||  to internally at the iaea as marj as - sultan , masyaf and iskandariya , referring to towns nearby .
the independent institute for science and international security in washington ( isis ) has  |||  identified  |||  these locations and found a complex of buildings on satellite images at masyaf which is very probably one of the suspicious buildings .
it may be  |||  located  |||  in or immediately next to a military base - it is precisely for this reason that syria is refusing the iaea access to the three locations .
in vienna , there is word that the syrians were afraid of some kind of  |||  fishing  |||  expedition and worry that the iaea is being sent out by the usa as a vanguard to spy out military facilities .
the iaea has documents , including satellite photos , which suggest that  |||  material  |||  has been transported between the three locations and the cube - shaped building on the euphrates river .
a high - ranking western diplomat in vienna said that at least one of the facilities could be " related to fuel  |||  production  |||  . "
this type of reactor is fuelled by uranium , but not  |||  enriched  |||  uranium .
no one is admitting to having any  |||  information  |||  on where the rubble has ended up , as if hundreds of truckloads of earth had simply vanished into thin air .
the salt  |||  mine  |||  of al tibni , located just several kilometres from el kibar on the other side of the euphrates and investigated by syria in 1998 as a possible storage location for radioactive waste is an unlikely location , according to the iaea .
images from orbit , however ,  |||  show  |||  that syria undertook earthworks at the three suspected locations and removed large containers after the iaea had demanded access .
that may be coincidence , but has done nothing to  |||  clear  |||  suspicion .
there is also talk in diplomatic circles of the iaea having  |||  spent  |||  a number of months developing an inspections plan that would allow syria to protect any military secrets - the costs alone shows the extent of the inspectors " interest .
damascus , however , also brushed off this  |||  proposal  |||  .
although western diplomats in vienna had offered reassurance , by saying that since the reactor was destroyed the  |||  issue  |||  had low priority , the us ambassador glyn davies has been bringing so - called special inspections to the table , which is one of the most powerful instruments available to the vienna - based atomic authority to carry out inspections .
the option is high risk . on the one hand it requires a majority in the governing council of the iaea , and a number of the 35 countries  |||  represented  |||  are anything other than eager for escalation .
on the other  |||  hand  |||  , as one diplomat points out , " what if , in the end , they find nothing ? "
|||  love  |||  in times of war
since angelina jolie began  |||  working  |||  on her as yet anonymous directing debut in the summer , there has been trouble .
bosnian women 's organisations have protested immediately , in response to which several days of shooting  |||  planned  |||  in sarajevo were moved to hungary at short notice .
however , she can hardly be described as diplomatic - jolie offered to  |||  meet  |||  the women weeks ago in hungary , but they declined .
the  |||  meeting  |||  must take place in bosnia , insists hasečić .
according to hasečić , there were no love stories in rape camps , and jolie 's behaviour towards victims told her  |||  enough  |||  about the script .
according to the un refugee organisation , her organisation has  |||  recommended  |||  dismissing jolie as an ambassador , reports the guardian .
but what kind of script  |||  exactly  |||  has jolie written ?
the bosnian ministry of culture that  |||  read  |||  her script issued a permit for shooting in sarajevo after some to - ing and fro - ing - it is not entirely clear why jolie then did not go to bosnia .
they fledgling writer herself asserts that she has no political motives in her film , has read up on the yugoslavian conflict assiduously and wants to show the horrific consequences of war and give a voice to all sides  |||  involved  |||  .
in terms of content , however , she remained  |||  vague  |||  .
that sounds a very different story to the " rape  |||  victim  |||  falls for torturer " scenario .
the fact that jolie 's film  |||  actually  |||  begins before the war is clear .
according to jolie , the pressure on her is " unfair and  |||  based  |||  on false information . "
now only the hackers from hollywood can give her any peace by  |||  illegally  |||  posting the script on the web , as has been the fate of so many other scripts .
this evening , everything is finally going well for the  |||  irish  |||  .
the  |||  home  |||  team is dominating its guests from sweden , finland and the usa too much for that .
the fans are hooting for joy against a soundtrack of blaring  |||  music  |||  and stamping feet .
the bailey pub in cork , southern ireland , is rocking because the table tennis  |||  players  |||  are throwing ping pong balls into beer glasses over a three metre distance - and scoring .
cian tanner is a quiet  |||  type  |||  ; this shrill drinking game and the reticent computer scientist do not really go together .
but the 26 - year - old is trying to amuse himself by playing , to distract from the burning question of what the future will  |||  bring  |||  .
" i have a weird  |||  feeling  |||  doing it , " he says .
still , his girlfriend is waiting for him in auckland - " she got her dream job as event manager in no time - perhaps a good  |||  sign  |||  , " says the young man and smiles .
in response to the  |||  poor  |||  outlook at home , two of tanner 's three siblings are already taking their chances abroad .
100,000  |||  irish  |||  men and women will leave the country in the near future , predict experts from the economic and social research institute ( esri ) in dublin .
for a small country with only 4.5 million inhabitants , that will be a  |||  significant  |||  loss .
if the predictions prove to be correct , there will be a wave of emigration comparable to the emigration  |||  ireland  |||  suffered in the 80s .
after a decade of growth that  |||  brought  |||  great prosperity for the irish with it , the hard times have returned .
the economic crisis is particularly bewildering for young , well - educated  |||  irish  |||  who have only seen things getting better .
everyone was  |||  needed  |||  and there was money abounding .
since then ,  |||  three  |||  out of every ten men and women under thirty are without work .
" there should be a revolution against the politicians and bankers - but anyone who can simply leaves and our country is  |||  losing  |||  an entire generation . "
" they are reducing the minimum  |||  wage  |||  , but they do n't have a strategy to create new jobs , " says the 20 - year - old .
she sees her fellow students making their way from one unpaid internship to  |||  another  |||  .
her greatest  |||  concern  |||  is that she will have to emigrate in four years as well .

on the other hand , men such as stephen mclarnon try to give the situation a  |||  positive  |||  spin .

" for people starting a career ,  |||  working  |||  abroad is a great chance to take your first steps onto the career ladder , " says the manager .
there are photos of surfers in australia and snowboarders in  |||  canada  |||  on his website .
the message is clear .  |||  working  |||  abroad is not galley duty , but a source of freedom and fun .
as there was nothing more for the 29 - year - old engineer in ireland , he is now working with 15  |||  irish  |||  colleagues on building sites in germany .
in the meantime , o'donovan visits his  |||  home  |||  country seldom , as he is taking on extra shifts to be able to pay off the mortgage on his house at home .
" the situation is really a bit crazy , " he says , as he goes through the door of his house for the first time in a  |||  long  |||  time .
" i am earning  |||  money  |||  in germany for a house in ireland that i barely see . "
the small house is in a classy neighbourhood with tended front gardens .  |||  large  |||  , expensive cars are parked in the driveways .
o'donovan bought the house with his sister four years ago for 380,000 euros -  |||  financed  |||  with a 100 percent mortgage .
" they were mad  |||  times  |||  - there was easy money without too many questions , " he says .
the civil engineer does not like the moaning that he hears so  |||  often  |||  .
" working abroad for a while is not the worst that can happen - perhaps we only really  |||  feel  |||  irish by going abroad . "
he laughs and recalls how his father went to england in the  |||  last  |||  great economic crisis .
cian tanner likes that  |||  idea  |||  .
leave the future  |||  open  |||  and just see what it is like living somewhere else .
he has already spent a few years  |||  working  |||  in london and why should things not go well for him and his girlfriendin new zealand ?

the second is the  |||  increasing  |||  stability of attitudes towards democracy and its core institutions .
support for democracy has risen noticeably in several countries on the pacific rim of south america ( see  |||  table  |||  1 ) .
for example in peru , where  |||  economic  |||  growth has averaged 6 % a year since 2002 , support for democracy has risen from a low of 40 % in 2005 to 61 % this year .
it also rose in mexico , where the economy has recovered after suffering a big drop in output  |||  last year  |||  .
but only  |||  around  |||  half of respondents in mexico and brazil , the region 's two most populous countries , are convinced democrats , which drags down the regional average ( see chart 2 ) .
some 44 % of respondents across the region pronounced themselves satisfied with how their country 's democracy works in practice , the same figure as last year but a big  |||  increase  |||  on the 25 % in 2001 ( chart 3 ) .
some 34 % said they had confidence in their country 's congress and 45 % in their government , the same as  |||  last  |||  year in both cases but up sharply from 2003 ( 17 % and 24 % respectively ) .
a decade ago  |||  economic  |||  woes in latin america undermined support for democracy .
that it has held up during the world financial crisis is probably because many latin american countries suffered only a brief recession and have enjoyed a  |||  strong  |||  recovery .
in addition , a stronger social safety net has helped to shield the  |||  poor  |||  .
( the united nations ' economic commission for latin america reported this week that the proportion of latin americans  |||  living  |||  in poverty rose only marginally in 2009 and has fallen again this year , to 32 % . )
but the  |||  mood  |||  varies widely from country to country ( see chart 4 ) .
brazil 's  |||  strong  |||  economic performance and the popularity of its outgoing president , luiz inácio lula da silva , is reflected in a widely shared sense of progress .
that is scarcer in mexico and central america , where the recession was more severe and violent  |||  crime  |||  has worsened .
for only the second time since the polls began , more respondents  |||  across  |||  latin america as a whole cite crime , rather than unemployment , as the most important problem facing their country ( see chart 5 ) .
some 31 % say that either they or a  |||  close  |||  relative have been victims of crime over the past year , but that is down from 38 % last year and is the lowest figure since 1995 .
a more robust economic performance is reflected in  |||  rising  |||  support for private enterprise and the market economy : some 71 % of respondents across the region say that private enterprise is indispensable for development , up from 56 % in 2007 ( see chart 6 ) .
some 58 % agree that the market economy is the only system that will make their country  |||  developed  |||  , up from 47 % last year .
but the united states is seen as the most influential country by respondents in mexico and much of central  |||  america  |||  , whereas venezuela enjoys that distinction in ecuador , the dominican republic and nicaragua .
nobody expected haiti 's  |||  general  |||  election on november 28th to be perfect .
but it was far worse than the outsiders who are trying to  |||  help  |||  the stricken country feared .
polling stations  |||  opened  |||  hours late .
many haitians , including lots displaced by january 's earthquake , roamed  |||  around  |||  trying to find out where to vote .
a dozen  |||  presidential  |||  candidates , including several presumed front - runners , cried fraud and called for the election 's annulment .
protests , some of them  |||  violent  |||  , flared across the country .
nevertheless , edmond mulet , the united nations ' top official in haiti ,  |||  declared  |||  it " a fairly good election in many ways . "
observers from the organisation of american states and the caribbean community said cautiously that they did " not believe these irregularities ,  |||  serious  |||  as they were , necessarily invalidated the process . "
in other words , the  |||  show  |||  goes on .
the electoral  |||  authority  |||  , which opponents claim is beholden to rené préval , the unpopular outgoing president and his candidate , jude célestin , is due to announce preliminary results on december 7th .
all hope in the election is not  |||  lost  |||  .
the two leading opposition candidates , michel martelly , a rap musician , and mirlande manigat , a former first lady , have retreated from their initial  |||  call  |||  for the vote to be declared invalid .
but there may be trouble if mr célestin , who has little or no discernible support among voters , is declared by the electoral authority to have  |||  reached  |||  the run - off .
with a cholera epidemic raging , and more than 1m earthquake survivors still living in tents , there were  |||  fears  |||  that turnout would be low .
in the event , a lot of haitians wanted to vote but were  |||  prevented  |||  from doing so by disorganisation .
some 250,000 identity cards ,  |||  required  |||  for voting , remained undistributed shortly before the election .
aid donors see the election of a legitimate and  |||  popular  |||  government as an essential step in haiti 's reconstruction .
and so , it is clear , do haitians  |||  themselves  |||  .
tiptoeing to the  |||  centre  |||
in the weeks since she was suddenly widowed , cristina fernández , argentina 's president , has benefited from a wave of public sympathy that has boosted her approval rating by 20 points , to over 50 % , its highest level since she was  |||  elected  |||  in 2007 .
yet turning this into a  |||  successful  |||  campaign for a second term at an election next year may depend on whether or not the visibly grieving ms fernández abandons the intransigence of her late husband , predecessor and political partner , néstor kirchner .
mr kirchner , who  |||  continued  |||  to handle economic policy even after his wife succeeded him as president , was in the habit of drawing up budgets which underestimated tax revenues , economic growth and inflation .
that  |||  allowed  |||  the first couple to spend the extra revenues at will .
on paper ms fernández 's government lost its majority in congress  |||  last year  |||  .
but the opposition is  |||  divided  |||  , and it was thrown further into disarray by mr kirchner 's death of a heart attack on october 27th .
some dissident  |||  members  |||  of the ruling peronist movement have rallied to ms fernández .
but after chaotic sessions ( in which a parliamentarian punched another in the face , and others accused the government of bribery ) , congress  |||  failed  |||  to approve the 2011 budget .
" i 'm not going to  |||  argue  |||  , " said the president .
the 2010 budget will now apply next year ,  |||  giving  |||  the president even more room to spend at will .
the economy is overheating wildly : it is likely to  |||  grow  |||  by up to 9 % this year .
the official inflation rate now stands at 11.1 % , but many private estimates - and trade - union wage demands - put the figure  |||  close  |||  to 30 % .
mr kirchner , who took office in 2003 when argentina was scarred by  |||  economic  |||  collapse , made growth and poverty reduction , rather than controlling inflation , his priorities .
he refused to  |||  deal  |||  with the imf , harassed the private sector and purged indec , the statistics agency , which proceeded to doctor official inflation statistics .
|||  might  |||  ms fernández now moderate these policies ?
she has called for talks between private  |||  business  |||  and union leaders .
and her officials are saying that they want to  |||  limit  |||  wage increases next year to 18 % .
the economy has been buoyed by high world prices for argentina 's  |||  farm  |||  exports .
but  |||  inflation  |||  has eroded the boost to growth provided by a big devaluation in 2002 .
that may be why ms fernández is showing signs of wanting to restore argentina 's financial ties to the  |||  rest  |||  of the world .
earlier this year the government struck a  |||  deal  |||  with bondholders who had refused an earlier forced restructuring of debt on which argentina defaulted in 2001 .
now ms fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the  |||  paris  |||  club , to which it owes some $ 6.7 billion .
but last month amado boudou , the economy minister , announced that the fund will  |||  provide  |||  " technical assistance " to design a new national consumer - price index , which looks like a prelude to cleaning up indec .
if she does , she needs to win the  |||  support  |||  of the middle class , much of which has tired of kirchnerismo .
by the time argentines  |||  return  |||  from their summer holidays in march , the wave of sympathy for her will have ebbed .
if she wants to win  |||  another  |||  election she will have to decide whether or not quietly to repudiate many of her husband 's policies .
half a cheer for  |||  china  |||
what does taiwan think of its big brother  |||  across  |||  the strait ?
more than 7. 5m voters turned out on november 27th , 70 % of those eligible , to elect mayors and city councillors in five urban districts , in what is seen as a  |||  broad  |||  assessment of the president , ma ying - jeou .
mr ma himself has become a surrogate for feelings about the mainland , having forged groundbreaking  |||  business  |||  links , including a partial free - trade pact , in the biggest rearrangement of relations with china proper since 1949 .
mr ma passed the  |||  test  |||  , but only just .
although his kuomintang party ( kmt ) ended up winning three of the five mayoralties , it  |||  failed  |||  to win a majority of the votes .
had this been a  |||  presidential  |||  poll , mr ma would be in trouble .
since he was  |||  elected  |||  two years ago his party 's share of the vote has fallen by perhaps 8 % .
for the first time , the dpp drew even with the kmt in the city  |||  councils  |||  .
the election saw most of the staples of taiwanese elections , including rowdy campaign trucks and flag - waving  |||  mass  |||  rallies with skimpily clad dancing girls .
it even saw the obligatory mysterious assassination  |||  attempt  |||  .
sean lien , son of lien chan , the kmt 's honorary chairman , was stumping for a kmt candidate on the eve of the  |||  election  |||  .
a man from the crowd shot the young mr lien clean through the  |||  face  |||  , wounding him and killing a bystander .
either way , says tsai ing - wen , the leader of the dpp , the shooting  |||  affected  |||  the election , casting suspicion on the dpp and driving voters towards the kmt .
perhaps the only big winner from the campaign was  |||  china  |||  .
it was striking how the  |||  issue  |||  of the mainland itself was absent .
instead candidates jousted over plans for  |||  public  |||  housing and job creation .
taiwan usually enjoys its de facto independence and loathes china 's  |||  military  |||  threat .
so , the kmt tends to avoid parading its ties to the  |||  government  |||  in beijing .
but this time the dpp also refrained from whipping up  |||  anti  |||  - china sentiment .
it is responding to a new awareness that chinese  |||  business  |||  is essential to taiwan 's economic survival .
the government in beijing can be  |||  expected  |||  to continue supplying commercial sweeteners , in line with its strategy for luring taiwan back to the fold .
china wasted no time sending a negotiator to taipei to arrange for a summit on investment protection and  |||  medical  |||  co - operation .
certainly , it would like to see  |||  political  |||  integration too , but first things first .
better to wait till after the 2012 presidential  |||  election  |||  for that .
the dpp has anyway reinvented  |||  itself  |||  .
two years ago it was at a low point : its  |||  former  |||  leader , chen shui - bian , had been sent to jail on charges of corruption .
but under the leadership of ms tsai , a new generation of moderates has emerged and the dpp is working  |||  hard  |||  to attract professionals and youths .
their party is now doing its best to  |||  show  |||  that it too can engage with beijing .
ms tsai announced plans for a think - tank to act as a point of contact between the dpp and china , provided their talks can be  |||  held  |||  without preconditions .
ms tsai tells the taiwanese  |||  public  |||  that her party presents a " trustworthy alternative " to mr ma 's hasty approach to china .
mr chen  |||  seems  |||  infuriated by the shift .
in a statement issued from his cell he said that the dpp 's candidates would have fared better if they had insisted that taiwan is a  |||  separate  |||  country .
he even  |||  ordered  |||  mr su , a pragmatist , not to run for the presidency .
even without mr chen 's interference , the dpp will struggle to  |||  choose  |||  between its potential candidates .
the kmt is due for soul -  |||  searching  |||  of its own .
mr ma 's ratings have been  |||  poor  |||  , despite breakneck economic growth ; kmt candidates have not wanted to campaign with him .
his unpopularity seems to be owing largely to unemployment and the widening gap between rich and  |||  poor  |||  .
a kmt spokesman  |||  says  |||  it will reshuffle its cabinet as well as its local branches .
the dpp 's  |||  strong  |||  showing suggests that taiwan 's support for rapprochement is limited .
at the same time most taiwanese see the  |||  economic  |||  integration with china as inevitable .
according to antonio chiang , a prominent columnist , " the  |||  point  |||  of no return has already passed . "
grammy nominations : jazz singer esperanza spalding is a surprise pick in  |||  best  |||  new artist category
considering that spalding has been a celebrated figure on the jazz scene since her 2008 album , " esperanza , " the nomination is a bit of a head - scratcher , but it is  |||  consistent  |||  with the grammys ' rules of an artist not releasing more than three albums before the recording that " establishes the public identity of that artist . "
her ambitious 2010 album , " chamber music society , " certainly marked a step forward , and given her airily inviting vocal style and a deft hand with pop , funk and latin influences , it 's possible to draw at least a dotted line to spalding from norah jones ' runaway success in 2003 , the closest equivalent to grammy voters  |||  looking  |||  toward jazz 's neighborhood in this category in recent years .
elsewhere grammy voters rightly honored the vijay iyer trio 's " historicity " in the instrumental album category , an invigorating thrill - ride of a record that was a critical favorite  |||  last year  |||  .
trombone shorty , a raucous new orleans favorite and  |||  frequent  |||  guest on hbo 's " treme , " was honored in the contemporary jazz category , which otherwise tilts heavily toward fusion with nods toward albums by stanley clarke , john mclaughlin and jeff lorber .
grammy awards nominations : michael daugherty , steve mackey  |||  lead  |||  classical categories
the classical nominations for the 53rd annual grammy awards feature a sprawling mix of musicians and composers from around the  |||  world  |||  .
among the nominees with ties to southern california is estonian composer arvo pärt for his symphony no. 4 , " los angeles , " a piece that was commissioned by the los angeles philharmonic and debuted at walt disney concert  |||  hall  |||  in 2009 .
l.a. - based composer avner dorman 's mandolin concerto is also up for an  |||  award  |||  .
the nominations for classical album are bruckner 's symphonies no. 3 and 4 from the royal concertgebouw orchestra ; daugherty 's " deus ex machina " and " metropolis symphony " from the nashville symphony orchestra ; steven mackey 's " dreamhouse " from the boston modern orchestra project and synergy vocals ; " sacrificium - the art of the castrati " featuring  |||  various  |||  artists ; and verdi 's " requiem " from the chicago symphony orchestra and chorus .
in the opera category , the nominees are berg 's " lulu " from the orchestra of the royal opera house ; adolf hasse 's " marc antonio e cleopatra " from ars lyrica houston ; kaija saariaho 's " l'amour de loin " from deutsches symphonie - orchester berlin ; rodion shchedrin 's " the enchanted wanderer " from the orchestra and chorus of the mariinsky theatre ; and arthur sullivan 's " ivanhoe " from the bbc  |||  national  |||  orchestra of wales .
composers who are up for grammys for contemporary composition  |||  include  |||  pärt for symphony no. 4 , daugherty for " deus ex machina , " hans werner henze for " appassionatamente plus , " magnus lindberg for " graffiti " and shchedrin for " the enchanted wanderer . "
the approximately 30 - minute piece is dubbed " los angeles " and is dedicated to  |||  former  |||  oil tycoon mikhail khodorkovsky , who is imprisoned in russia .
dorman 's " mandolin concerto " was nominated for instrumental soloist  |||  performance  |||  with orchestra .
" i wrote it  |||  using  |||  middle eastern sounds and a lot of north african scales and rhythms , " said dorman in a phone interview .
conductor pierre boulez , 85 ,  |||  received  |||  a nomination in the category of orchestral performance , for leading the chicago symphony in a recording of works by stravinsky .
instrumental soloists who received nominations  |||  include  |||  pianists nelson freire and marc - andré hamelin ; organist paul jacobs ; violinist julia fischer ; and harpist sarah schuster ericsson .
in the classical crossover category , soprano jessye norman  |||  received  |||  a nomination for her recording " roots - my life , my song . "
proposed temecula mosque wins planning commission  |||  approval  |||
a proposed mosque in temecula has won the unanimous  |||  support  |||  of the local planning commission following more than five hours of often heated public testimony .
critics assailed the project as  |||  promoting  |||  both terrorism and traffic tie - ups .
but commissioners ruled wednesday night the new  |||  religious  |||  center complied with local laws and would be aesthetically impressive .
" many good people came to support it - christians , jews , bahais , you name it , " said hadi nael ,  |||  chair  |||  of the islamic center of temecula valley , speaking thursday morning .
" i 'm proud of that as an  |||  american  |||  citizen . "
" it shows that justice  |||  prevails  |||  . "
" the opposition is very  |||  minimal  |||  , " he added .
" they just have very  |||  loud  |||  voices . "
" we have beautiful people in this  |||  valley  |||  . "
the meeting began at 6 p.m. and lasted until nearly midnight with most of the time taken up with people speaking for or against the center , about evenly  |||  divided  |||  , according to the press - enterprise .
the debate  |||  continued  |||  on the newspaper 's website .
" there is no more  |||  america  |||  , " wrote one commenter .
" it is another planet of the apes with miss  |||  liberty  |||  dead in the sand . "
"  |||  america  |||  has fallen . "
|||  planned  |||  islamic centers also have sparked protests in other parts of the country , including near ground zero , the site of the sept. 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks in new york city .
in the temecula valley , imam  |||  mahmoud  |||  harmoush has denounced violence .
his congregation of about 135 families has co - existed without incident in riverside county for years but wanted a larger and better space than the warehouse it rented on a property  |||  shared  |||  with a manufacturer of water - filtration systems .
it would occupy a 4.32 - acre site on nicolas  |||  road  |||  about two miles east of chaparral high school .
|||  opponents  |||  can still appeal the project to the city council .
while researchers discovered the unusual bacteria here on earth , they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that have been  |||  considered  |||  essential .
" this organism has dual  |||  capability  |||  . "
" it can  |||  grow  |||  with either phosphorous or arsenic . "
" that makes it very peculiar ,  |||  though  |||  it falls short of being some form of truly ' alien ' life , " commented paul c. w. davies of arizona state university , a co - author of the report appearing in thursday 's online edition of the journal science .
six major elements have long been  |||  considered  |||  essential for life - carbon , hydrogen , nitrogen , oxygen , phosphorus and sulfur .
but the  |||  researchers  |||  found that the bacteria , discovered in mono lake , calif. , is able to continue to grow after substituting arsenic for phosphorous .
the find is important in the search for life  |||  beyond  |||  earth because researchers need to be able to recognize life , to know what life looks like , anbar said .
the  |||  study  |||  focuses on a microbe found on earth .
however , the announcement of a news conference to discuss it , which did not disclose details of the find , generated  |||  widespread  |||  speculation on the internet that the report would disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life .
the discovery " does show that in other planetary environments organisms might be able to use other elements to drive biochemistry and that the ' standard ' set of elements we think are absolutely necessary for life might not be so fixed , " commented charles cockell , professor at the planetary and space sciences research institute ,  |||  open  |||  university , in milton keynes , united kingdom .
cockell was not part of the  |||  research  |||  team .
" this work is novel because it shows the substitution of one element for  |||  another  |||  in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure , " added cockell .
arsenic and phosphorous are chemically similar , so she speculated that a microbe exposed to both  |||  might  |||  be able to substitute one for the other .
" arsenic is toxic mainly because its  |||  chemical  |||  behavior is so similar to that of phosphorus . "
" but arsenic is  |||  different  |||  enough that it does n't work as well as phosphorus , so it gets in there and sort of gums up the works of our biochemical machinery , " explained anbar .
the researchers collected the bacteria known as gfaj - 1 and exposed it to  |||  increasing  |||  concentrations of arsenic , which it was able to adapt to and grow .
the microbe does grow better on phosphorous , but showing that it can live with arsenic instead raises the possibility that a life form  |||  using  |||  arsenic could occur naturally , either elsewhere on earth or on another planet or moon where arsenic is more common .
" it does suggest that that there could be other ways to form life , not just how life formed on  |||  early  |||  earth , " said foster , who was not part of wolfe - simon 's research team .
the research was  |||  supported  |||  by nasa , the department of energy and the national institutes of health .
|||  remaining  |||  stolen show dogs found in compton
two of the canines were recovered wednesday afternoon , and the remaining two were found late wednesday evening , said to steve whitmore , a spokesman for the los angeles county sheriff 's  |||  department  |||  .
" the good news is that the dogs are  |||  fine  |||  , " said whitmore .
" they are in good  |||  condition  |||  . "
" they have been returned to their rightful  |||  owners  |||  . "
whitmore  |||  declined  |||  to say precisely where the dogs were found , in what neighborhood , and the circumstances surrounding their discovery .
the dogs owners , kristina rickard and david peek , could not be reached for  |||  comment  |||  thursday .
they were reunited with their two akitas at a county - run animal shelter in downey on  |||  wednesday  |||  afternoon .
sheriff 's deputies found the van and the two dogs  |||  separately  |||  in compton .
the akitas - trace , a 3 - year - old male , and didi , a 10 - month - old female - were unharmed ,  |||  authorities  |||  said .
but bunny and peter , the corgis rickard and peek  |||  planned  |||  to show at area competitions this week on behalf of the dogs ' japanese owners , remained missing until their discovering late wednesday .
peek and rickard , who live in redding , are in town for the akc / eukanuba national championship in long beach this weekend , where they  |||  planned  |||  to show trace .
the other dogs were expected to compete in other competitions  |||  scheduled  |||  in the days before the akc / eukanuba show , peek told the times on wednesday .
southern california is one  |||  stop  |||  on the couple 's nearly month - long tour of dog shows .
they often stay in motels and park their van right outside their  |||  room  |||  window .
but they  |||  left  |||  the thick - furred akitas and corgis in the van where it would be cooler .
peek had said they would offer a reward to anyone who could lead them to the corgis , which are implanted with microchips to  |||  identify  |||  them .
it was  |||  unclear  |||  thursday whether an award would be given .
lion ready to roar again as mgm restructuring gets  |||  final  |||  court go - ahead
after 18 months of turmoil and uncertainty , mgm has finally gotten a green light to  |||  start  |||  anew .
a new york federal bankruptcy judge on thursday officially blessed the " pre - packaged " plan by creditors to wipe out about $ 5 billion in  |||  debt  |||  , clearing the way for the 86 - year - old entertainment company to focus its efforts on producing and releasing movies and television shows .
with thursday 's ruling that the plan meets the requirements of the u.s. bankruptcy code , no more legal obstacles remain for mgm to relaunch under spyglass entertainment founders gary barber and roger birnbaum , who will  |||  become  |||  chief executives of what will be a slimmed - down studio .
the  |||  staff  |||  will drop to about 320 from over 400 .
mgm will not actually emerge from chapter 11 until jpmorgan chase closes a  |||  planned  |||  $ 500 - million loan facility to fund the new mgm 's operations and productions .
it is currently being syndicated by the investment bank - which is  |||  itself  |||  kicking in $ 75 million - and is expected to be funded by mid - december .
the studio 's restructuring process  |||  began  |||  in may 2009 , when investment bank moelis & co. was hired to advise management on how to fix its finances as it was struggling to afford interest payments of $ 300 million per year .
that august , chief executive harry sloan was replaced by stephen cooper , a former ceo of enron and a turnaround expert  |||  known  |||  for his work at krispy kreme doughnuts .
moelis ' and cooper 's attempts to resolve mgm 's financial woes and satisfy the studio 's 140 - plus creditors took much longer than  |||  expected  |||  .
after several months of discussions , the parties  |||  agreed  |||  in late 2009 to put the company up for sale .
by the spring of this year , it was  |||  back  |||  to the drawing board as the mgm team began working on a restructuring plan that , after months of debate and internal disagreements , was finally endorsed by creditors in late october .
when mgm officially emerges from bankruptcy in the  |||  coming  |||  weeks , moelis and cooper 's firms will receive multimillion - dollar bonuses for their work .
moelis & co. , which has already  |||  received  |||  $ 1.2 million , will get a $ 9.5 - million payment .
barber and birnbaum plan to restart production at mgm , which released only one movie this year , and put together an annual slate of seven or eight films that will come out  |||  starting  |||  in 2012 .
they also plan to co -  |||  finance  |||  two movies based on " the hobbit , " along with warner bros .
the studio needs to close a  |||  separate  |||  loan of between $ 265 million and $ 275 million to fund its portion of those two movies , which are to be directed by peter jackson .
however , recent talks between the two companies have not resulted in a  |||  deal  |||  .
tech toys to  |||  keep  |||  your gift budget in balance
but there are ways to  |||  keep  |||  your gift budget in balance .
i recently visited three  |||  national  |||  toy sellers - a wal - mart , a toys " r " us and a bj 's wholesale club - to see what electronic toys i could buy for less than $ 80 .
it was immediately  |||  clear  |||  that moore 's law has been at work ; this year 's technology toy is likely to have more power , while costing the same if not a bit less compared with last year 's .
and button - cell powered toys are  |||  increasing  |||  , as well as toys with rechargable batteries .
here are some  |||  recommendations  |||  .
caution : once you  |||  start  |||  squeezing , you ca n't stop .
for singing  |||  combined  |||  with dancing , dance star mickey ( fisher - price , $ 60 , for ages 2 and up ) is the best choice .
borrowing on last year 's elmo  |||  live  |||  technology , the 14 - inch animatronic doll plays turn - taking games like simon says , and can moon walk , thanks to his innovative hinged feet with locking wheels .
children testing the toy used mickey as a dance instructor  |||  although  |||  their parents complained about the lack of a volume control .
if you 're leery of handing your  |||  child  |||  your smartphone , here are three stand - alone alternatives .
vtech 's mobigo ( $ 60 , for ages 3 to 8 ) is the cheapest and easiest to use , featuring a qwerty keyboard , although the games do n't teach as effectively as the leapster explorer ( $ 70 , for ages 3 to 12 ) , leapfrog 's first  |||  major  |||  overhaul of the leapster line , with a newer , brighter screen .
neither version is  |||  compatible  |||  with older cartridges .
fisher - price 's ixl ( $ 90 , for ages 3 to 7 ) uses an itunes - like system to deliver games and e-books , and has an sd card slot that makes it possible to display  |||  family  |||  photos .
finally , scrabble flash ( $ 30 , hasbro , for ages 8 and up ) is a set of five blocks just larger than a book of matches ,  |||  each  |||  with its own led screen .
the goal is to make words by placing the blocks in a row  |||  before  |||  time runs out ; it 's great for an impromptu spelling contest .

|||  bringing  |||  a softer side to policing in china
like an urban drill sergeant , tang shenbin paced on a city square , sternly inspecting his nervous charges , issuing sotto voce commands with military  |||  authority  |||  .
he wanted the female members of chengguan - china 's burly enforcers of urban  |||  order  |||  , feared and despised for their capricious crackdowns and penchant for violence - to convey a certain impression to a clutch of onlookers .
|||  show  |||  them , he whispered , " what pretty girls are like ! "
four barely - past - teenage girls in white gloves and  |||  identical  |||  olive jackets and pants snapped to attention .
|||  four  |||  pairs of black pumps lined up ruler - straight .
" models are  |||  pretty  |||  . "
more than one  |||  government  |||  has tried to brush up the image of china 's urban inspectors .
guangdong province  |||  changed  |||  the gray - green uniforms to a supposedly more inviting blue .
xindu , an urban district of 680,000 in chengdu , has chosen  |||  major  |||  image surgery .
since 2003 , the district has supplemented its urban street police with 13 women , specifically  |||  chosen  |||  for their looks , shapeliness and youth .
the idea is to give the rough - hewn police a softer , feminine  |||  side  |||  .
unlike the police , these officers are authorized only to enforce city ordinances by imposing fines and other administrative  |||  penalties  |||  .
but the chinese news media routinely portray a  |||  different  |||  reality .
last year , a  |||  training  |||  manual for beijing inspectors , pilfered and posted online , described how to effectively thrash offenders without drawing blood .
one violence - soaked video game , available for download online , features  |||  chinese  |||  - trained inspectors who assault street vendors .
" chengguan has scarred the government , " china daily , a national publication , lamented  |||  last year  |||  after yet another controversy over tactics .
the  |||  paper  |||  demanded a " truly thorough clean - up . "
skeptics say the  |||  approach  |||  here falls far short of that .
after the district advertised for eight new female recruits in october , an editorial in the beijing evening news questioned whether the women had  |||  actual  |||  duties or were simply scenic diversions .
the district 's advertisement called for female applicants 18 to 22 years old , with a good figure and " the five facial  |||  features  |||  in proper order . "
they should be above -  |||  average  |||  height - taller than 1.6 meters or 5 feet , 2 1⁄2 inches .
|||  officials  |||  said the job was physically too arduous for women over 25 .
" their image is the important thing , " one unnamed district official  |||  told  |||  rednet.com , a quasi - governmental web site .
" first , the candidates ' external qualities will  |||  determine  |||  if they make the cut , such as height , weight , facial features , etc. "
female chengguan are like flower vases , he said , adding , " besides being vases , they will have other  |||  responsibilities  |||  . "
zheng lihua , the deputy director of the district 's  |||  city  |||  management bureau , is not eager to endorse that description .
so is the demand for orderly facial  |||  features  |||  .
|||  certainly  |||  , the disabled or disfigured need not apply .
" we ca n't let a lame  |||  person  |||  or a hunchback come to serve here , " mr. zheng said .
" his  |||  image  |||  would not be good . "
liu yi , who patrols the baoguang square  |||  near  |||  a monastery , is 22 , apple - cheeked with a finely curved mouth .
she does not consider the  |||  stress  |||  on her appearance to be sexist , she said .
said her dimpled co - worker , 21 - year - old xu yang , " our job is to present the  |||  city  |||  's image . "
they do not object to their  |||  limited  |||  tenure either , they said , because they harbor career ambitions greater than simply shooing vendors into the alleyways where they are supposed to confine their business .
|||  every  |||  morning , the squad faces off against a dozen or so peddlers who dart around on foot or bicycle , trying to sell as many buns or bowls of tofu as possible before they are run off .
" we have told you many  |||  times  |||  ! " said ms. xu as one vendor fled on foot , temporarily deserting his bicycle - drawn cart of noodle - fixings .
the officers  |||  describe  |||  their duties as more monotonous than strenuous .
" it is pretty much the same  |||  every  |||  day , " said huang jing , 20 , who studies marketing in her off hours .
one reason is that female officers lack the  |||  power  |||  of their male counterparts to confiscate vendors ' goods .
that tends to shield them from the sudden public displays of animosity against officialdom that are common  |||  throughout  |||  china .
this year hundreds of citizens in kunming , the yunnan provincial capital , rioted after false rumors spread that chengguan officers had  |||  killed  |||  a vendor .
more than a dozen police or chengguan officers were injured in the nighttime episode ; 14  |||  government  |||  vehicles were overturned or set on fire .
xindu has so far  |||  escaped  |||  such violence .
but calm is hardly  |||  guaranteed  |||  .
just two blocks from placid baoguang square , where the female officers patrolled that  |||  morning  |||  , more than 50 people gathered on a street corner .
officers had confiscated a motorcycle that was being repaired on the sidewalk instead of inside a shop , as regulations  |||  require  |||  .
a 15 - minute standoff ensued before the officers , grim - faced , elbowed their way to their vehicles and sped off with the motorcycle and its  |||  owner  |||  .
li xuedong , 40 , a coordinator attached to the male squad , remained behind , his white badge flipped over to conceal his  |||  name  |||  .
"  |||  sometimes  |||  we fight verbally . "
"  |||  sometimes  |||  we fight physically , " mr. li said matter - of - factly .
" most of the time it is the  |||  public  |||  who starts it . "
justice department prosecutors have cleared senator john ensign of criminal allegations arising from his affair with a former campaign aide and his efforts to  |||  secure  |||  lobbying work for the woman 's husband , the senator 's lawyers announced wednesday .
the decision ends the most serious legal threat facing mr. ensign , the nevada republican who was  |||  considered  |||  a possible republican presidential candidate in 2012 until the scandal over his affair made national headlines last year and damaged his career .
mr. ensign 's office said he was " certainly pleased " by the decision , which  |||  followed  |||  a yearlong investigation .
the senator could still  |||  face  |||  disciplinary action by the senate ethics committee .
mr. ensign 's lawyers said the justice department had " informed us that senator ensign is no longer a target of its investigation and that it has no plans to bring any charges against him in this  |||  matter  |||  . "
the announcement came as something of a surprise to many ethics lawyers outside the justice department , who said there appeared to be  |||  significant  |||  evidence to indicate that mr. ensign may have conspired to violate a criminal ban on federal lobbying .
interviews , e-mail and other documents first disclosed in october 2009 in the new york times indicated that mr. ensign had helped douglas hampton , who was one of his aides ,  |||  secure  |||  lucrative lobbying work to win the silence of mr. hampton and his wife , cynthia , about the senator 's affair with her .
because mr. hampton had recently been an aide to mr. ensign , he was barred by law from lobbying his  |||  former  |||  employer or the senate as a whole for a year .
ethics experts said the unusual arrangement between mr. ensign and mr. hampton , who were close friends  |||  before  |||  the affair , appeared at odds with the so - called revolving door lobbying ban .
while justice department officials declined to explain the reasoning behind the decision in the ensign case , mr. brand and other ethics lawyers said the department appeared wary of taking on political prosecutions after a  |||  number  |||  of high - profile setbacks for its public integrity section , including the decision last year to drop the prosecution against former senator ted stevens amid charges of prosecutorial misconduct .
" this basically says  |||  high  |||  - ranking government officials can now assume the laws do n't apply to them , " she added .
paul coggins , mr. ensign 's  |||  lead  |||  lawyer , said in an interview that he received a phone call from a justice department prosecutor on monday and a follow - up the next day , telling him that the department was not seeking charges against his client .
mr. coggins declined to spell out the  |||  legal  |||  arguments he made to prosecutors .
" i 'm not comfortable going into the details of my discussions with the justice department except to say that we think they made the  |||  right  |||  decision , " he said .
last month , the federal election commission decided to drop an investigation into a  |||  separate  |||  complaint by the ethics group alleging that a $ 96,000 payment from mr. ensign 's parents to the hamptons violated federal election law .
one company for which mr. ensign helped mr. hampton find lobbying work was nv energy , a  |||  major  |||  nevada company that had long supported the senator .
one e-mail sent in december 2008 showed that after the company brought mr. hampton on as a lobbyist , mr. ensign 's chief of  |||  staff  |||  , john lopez , communicated with mr. hampton and told him that he was " pounding " the interior department over an issue in dispute .
when news of the affair first surfaced  |||  last  |||  year , mr. ensign apologized to his constituents and resigned his position as the fourth - ranking republican leader in the senate .
after keeping a low profile for many months , mr. ensign told reporters two weeks ago that he  |||  planned  |||  to run for a third term in the senate .
in announcing that mr. ensign was no longer the target of a  |||  criminal  |||  investigation , his spokeswoman , jennifer cooper , said the senator hoped the ethics committee would quickly follow the justice department 's lead and end its inquiry .
" senator ensign looks forward to continuing his  |||  hard  |||  work on behalf of the people of nevada , " she said .
cheshire appeal will point to  |||  twitter  |||
there were half a  |||  dozen  |||  of them typing away in the courtroom rows .
in the end , the defense says , there were more than 140,000 twitter messages about the trial that dealt with rape and children tied to their beds in a  |||  house  |||  that was set ablaze .
on thursday , the widely followed trial of steven j. hayes , who was convicted of killing three members of a cheshire , conn. ,  |||  family  |||  , is set to come to an official end with the judge 's imposition of the death sentence voted for by the jury .
but lawyers for mr. hayes have already made court filings that sketch out appeals arguments that are  |||  likely  |||  to occupy the courts for years .
one of the most provocative is that the intense reporting on the trial - including mainstream reporters ' extensive use of twitter - created a " circus atmosphere " and such  |||  widespread  |||  , instant saturation with inflammatory details that the jury was improperly swayed by public passions .
the claim could  |||  force  |||  appeals judges to grapple with the question of whether new technology requires new courtroom rules .
" as i experienced it during this trial , i think there 's a real danger that the inclusion of new technology in the courtroom is  |||  affecting  |||  an individual 's fair - trial rights , " said thomas j. ullmann , mr. hayes 's chief defense lawyer .
the trial judge , jon c. blue of state superior court , tersely rejected the claims in a ruling last week ,  |||  saying  |||  that the news media were " carefully controlled " and that there was no evidence the jury was driven by passion .
but that is not  |||  likely  |||  to be the last word on the issue .
for decades , appeals courts have recognized that coverage of notorious cases can  |||  raise  |||  questions about a trial 's fairness .
in a landmark 1966 ruling , the  |||  united  |||  states supreme court overturned the conviction of a cleveland osteopath , dr. sam sheppard , for the murder of his wife , saying in its decision , sheppard v. maxwell , that there was a " carnival atmosphere at trial " because of the news media .
the crime is believed by some to have been the inspiration for the television  |||  show  |||  and the movie " the fugitive . "
some lawyers said appeals courts reviewing mr. hayes 's conviction half a century later might be intrigued by the argument that new rules could be  |||  necessary  |||  to govern ways of communicating from courtrooms unimagined at the time of dr. sheppard 's case .
" there is a  |||  general  |||  reason for concern about the impact of the new media " in high - profile trials , said john j. donohue iii , a stanford law school professor who studied the connecticut death penalty and wrote a report that said it was arbitrarily enforced .
professor donohue said some appeals judges  |||  might  |||  be intrigued by the idea that limiting instant communication from courtrooms might make trials fairer .
the twitter issue is just one of many outlined by mr. hayes 's lawyers that are likely to be argued for years , delaying an  |||  execution  |||  .
the defense lawyers also claim , for example , that mr. hayes may have been prejudiced when judge blue declined to allow them to  |||  test  |||  potential jurors ' reactions by showing them grisly crime - scene photographs during jury selection .
but their arguments about the  |||  effect  |||  of the intense coverage of the trial may draw the most interest .
they noted in a challenge to the verdict filed last month that the case dominated the news in connecticut and was  |||  discussed  |||  during the election campaign by candidates for governor and the united states senate .
they  |||  argued  |||  that the news media continually fanned the flames of emotion about the case .
their  |||  focus  |||  on the twitter coverage is controversial .
in interviews , some journalists said the claim that instant news was more incendiary than reports delivered more slowly was a luddite  |||  view  |||  that would make poor court policy governing coverage of future trials .
but some lawyers said appeals courts were often attracted to arguments that social and technological changes  |||  required  |||  adaptation by the courts .
in their filing , they referred to the supreme court 's 1966 decision overturning dr. sheppard 's conviction because of the trial coverage and made it clear they would claim that the new media  |||  required  |||  new rules .
" this  |||  case  |||  , " they wrote , " represents the sheppard v. maxwell of the 21st century . "
can civility bridge the  |||  divide  |||  ?
after a campaign notable for invective and negativity , a modicum of civility has broken out in  |||  washington  |||  this week .
is it a harbinger of genuine bipartisan cooperation ahead or an illusory  |||  moment  |||  before a quick return to partisan combat in the capital ?
but by all accounts , it was at least a polite discussion of the two sides ' differences as well as a recognition of their  |||  shared  |||  responsibilities to govern , rather than another empty episode of partisan point scoring .
wednesday 's public  |||  meeting  |||  of the president 's deficit commission was equally civilized , despite the policy differences that remain among the members .
it seems clear that  |||  close  |||  interaction over a period of months produced a mutual respect that transcends the ideological gulf that still separates the members .
that 's hardly  |||  enough  |||  to declare that a new era of cooperation has arrived .
both sides are now in a period of testing - probing one another for signs of cooperativeness and compromise while trying to evaluate the limits of public opinion and voters ' patience for  |||  renewed  |||  partisan warfare .
which is why the meeting on tuesday and the participants ' reviews of it afterward were done with a minimum of  |||  demands  |||  or accusations .
the philosophical differences between obama and the republicans are too  |||  large  |||  and too deeply held to suggest any quick change in the climate that existed during the past two years .
whether the  |||  issue  |||  is taxes , spending , health care or entitlements , the two sides remain miles apart .
still , the november election has tempered washington , at least in the  |||  short  |||  term .
" there 's no question that tonally things have  |||  changed  |||  , " said pete wehner , a bush administration official now with the ethics and public policy center .
" those are  |||  inevitable  |||  after elections .
|||  elections  |||  arouse partisan passions , and then they die down .
on some issues , particularly those on the agenda for the lame - duck session , republicans and democrats have  |||  little  |||  choice but to find a solution .
the bush tax  |||  cuts  |||  expire at the end of the year , and nobody favors that .
both sides want to find a way to preserve some or all of them ,  |||  permanently  |||  or temporarily .
similarly , compromise is likely on extending unemployment benefits , if only because republicans ca n't afford to  |||  look  |||  like they favor tax cuts for the wealthy while denying jobless workers unemployment compensation .
after tuesday 's meeting at the white house , there is greater optimism for a possible  |||  deal  |||  on these issues during the lame duck session , along with ratification of the new start pact .
but william galston of the brookings institution cautions that successful cooperation on the pressing  |||  issues  |||  of the lame - duck session will not necessarily lead to continued bipartisanship when the new 112th congress convenes in january .
instead , he said , a period of disagreement is likely , even  |||  inevitable  |||  .
wehner , too , expressed skepticism - which is widely shared - that civility will lead to  |||  real  |||  cooperation .
" i view most of what happens between now and 2012 as an undercard , or  |||  shadow  |||  boxing , to the main event in 2012 , " he said .
the reasons have much to do with the makeup of the new republican majority in the house and the tea party voters who were instrumental in  |||  creating  |||  it .
however mindful republican  |||  leaders  |||  are of the dangers of overplaying their hand , they know they must try to live up to their promises to cut government spending and repeal the new health - care law .
those partisan lines are already clear in the initial reactions to the deficit commission recommendations , which  |||  include  |||  reforming the tax code and raising some taxes , raising the retirement age and cutting spending .
the greatest resistance is among the  |||  elected  |||  officials on the panel , suggesting that on fiscal issues there is , today at least , little grounds for or desire for compromise .
galston predicts two phases in the battles between the  |||  white  |||  house and congressional republicans .
the first will come next year in the form of partisan clashes , as republicans challenge obama on the budget , taxes and  |||  health  |||  care , followed later by a period of greater bipartisan cooperation .
public  |||  opinion  |||  .
there is considerable evidence that , despite the partisanship of the  |||  recent  |||  election , a majority of americans still want to see the two parties work together .
if confrontation leads to stalemate , as it did in 1995 , then both parties will be carefully watching the  |||  public  |||  reaction .
whoever is judged to be losing is likely to shift course and  |||  seek  |||  compromise .
that , however , may be an optimistic  |||  view  |||  .
partisanship and polarization are greater today than they were in the mid - 1990s , and there  |||  appears  |||  to be a bigger ideological gap between obama and congressional republicans than there was between president bill clinton and the republicans then .
at the same time , activists in both parties see 2010 as mere prelude to a more consequential  |||  election  |||  in 2012 .
given that  |||  reality  |||  , the civility on display this week may be welcomed by many americans .
but it will take much more effort on the part of both sides to find common  |||  ground  |||  on the issues that still divide them .
leaked u.s. document portrays  |||  moscow  |||  as haven of corruption
both the police and the federal security service run huge protection rackets that help account for the high cost of  |||  living  |||  in moscow , it said .
they collect money not only from legitimate businesses but from  |||  organized  |||  criminal groups as well .
each layer of the bureaucracy - what  |||  prime minister  |||  vladimir putin has termed the " vertical of authority " - takes its cut as the money moves up the ladder .
the memo , which was sent to washington under the name of ambassador john beyrle , was posted by wikileaks on its web  |||  site  |||  wednesday .
the memo is  |||  based  |||  on sources whose names have been redacted .
it was written while yuri luzhkov was still moscow 's mayor , and it blames him for much of the  |||  corruption  |||  .
luzhkov and his wife , yelena baturina , who owns a prominent construction  |||  firm  |||  , have consistently denied corruption accusations over the years , and he has won several libel suits over such accusations .
in september he told a  |||  russian  |||  television station , when asked about a documentary suggesting he was corrupt : " it is mad , it is filth , it is a mess . "
russians overwhelmingly  |||  believe  |||  that theirs is a corrupt society , polls have shown .
but it is  |||  unusual  |||  to find the particulars spelled out as they were in the embassy 's report , and it is unheard of that it should be diplomats from a foreign country doing so .
" criminal elements  |||  enjoy  |||  a ' krysha ' ( a term from the criminal / mafia world literally meaning ' roof ' or protection ) that runs through the police , the federal security service ( fsb ) , ministry of internal affairs ( mvd ) , and the prosecutor 's office , as well as throughout the moscow city government bureaucracy .
" the fsb , mvd and militia are at the  |||  second  |||  level . "
" finally ,  |||  ordinary  |||  criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level . "
" this is an inefficient system in which  |||  criminal  |||  groups fill a void in some areas because the city is not providing some services . "
the report says that the fsb rakes in money from the biggest firms , and that the police target  |||  small  |||  businesses .
one source , it said , " explained that moscow  |||  business  |||  owners understand that it is best to get protection from the mvd and fsb ( rather than organized crime groups ) since they not only have more guns , resources , and power than criminal groups , but they are also protected by the law . "
" for this reason , protection from  |||  criminal  |||  gangs is no longer so high in demand . "
the memo notes that , while the collection of money is comprehensive , the protection  |||  itself  |||  can be spotty ; even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest .
the embassy memo relays reports of men taking suitcases , presumably stuffed with cash , into the kremlin  |||  itself  |||  .
" in his fight against corruption , medvedev has to rely on bureaucrats , " georgy satarov , director of the moscow think tank indem , said in a  |||  recent  |||  interview .
" but he is a  |||  part  |||  of this bureaucracy . "
" he is not part of a  |||  political  |||  class , because a political class does n't exist in russia anymore . "
without politics , without an  |||  opposition  |||  , without a separation of powers , he said , corruption is inevitable .
nationwide , indem estimates that corruption  |||  costs  |||  russia more than $ 300 billion a year .
the country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on  |||  global  |||  perceptions of corruption by the nongovernmental organization transparency international ( countries are ranked from least to most corrupt ) .
the disclosure of the u.s. embassy memo , which did n't occur until late evening moscow time , is  |||  sure  |||  to stir displeasure within the russian government , although to the extent that luzhkov can be blamed for moscow 's failings , it might be an opportunity for the kremlin to argue that it is solving the problem .
interviewed for cnn by larry king , putin suggested that the wikileaks  |||  documents  |||  may be fabrications and reacted angrily to a disclosure that u.s. diplomats had called him batman to medvedev 's robin .
" the truth of the  |||  matter  |||  is , this is about our interaction , which is an important factor of the domestic policies in this country , " he said .
khmer rouge veterans forced to confront the  |||  past  |||
"  |||  everyone  |||  here loves ta mok . "
" he was a good  |||  leader  |||  , and he cared about his people , " said sreng kor ma , 42 .
but this year , 12 years after the khmer rouge surrendered to the  |||  government  |||  , long - held loyalties are finally being challenged in anlong veng .
in april , a local  |||  truth  |||  and reconciliation forum allowed victims to publicly confront people who had participated in the regime .
in june , the  |||  government  |||  distributed a high school textbook here that for the first time teaches the history of the khmer rouge to the children of its former soldiers .
and in july , a joint u.n. and cambodian tribunal handed down its first conviction of a  |||  former  |||  khmer rouge member , sentencing the onetime chief of the notorious tuol sleng torture center , kaing khek iev , better known as duch , to 35 years in prison .
with  |||  each  |||  of those developments , anxiety has grown among anlong veng 's khmer rouge veterans , complicating efforts at reconciliation and their attempts to reintegrate into cambodian society .
" there is resentment and fear among the former khmer rouge , but they are powerless to do anything , " said chhang youk ,  |||  head  |||  of the documentation center of cambodia , an independent organization that researches the regime .
" for them ,  |||  life  |||  under the khmer rouge was glorious , but the regime has become symbolic of evil . "
during the khmer rouge rule of cambodia , from 1975 until 1979 , an estimated 1.7 million people were executed or died from starvation ,  |||  disease  |||  or overwork .
there they launched an insurgency that endured until the  |||  last  |||  of the movement surrendered in december 1998 .
but in the mid - 1990s , after a u.n. - sponsored peace agreement led to the country 's first democratic elections in 1993 ,  |||  large  |||  groups of khmer rouge fighters began defecting to the government , culminating in the surrenders of ieng sary in 1996 and nuon chea and khieu samphan in 1998 .
pol pot died of  |||  natural  |||  causes in 1998 , and ta mok , who had held out , was captured by government forces in 1999 in the nearby dangrek mountains .
he died in a phnom penh prison in 2006 while awaiting  |||  trial  |||  .
with their benefactors no longer providing for them , most  |||  former  |||  khmer rouge fighters have descended into the grinding poverty common in rural cambodia , and many remain nostalgic for the movement .
" these people have benefited very little following the surrender , " said sok leang of the center for justice and reconciliation , which holds public forums  |||  throughout  |||  cambodia , including in anlong veng .
" they are embedded with the utopian agrarian  |||  ideology  |||  of the regime . "
" they were brought up with no concept of doing  |||  business  |||  . "
"  |||  life  |||  under the khmer rouge was good , " he said .
" but now , life is difficult because we have to  |||  provide  |||  for ourselves . "
the ongoing khmer rouge tribunal has also provoked  |||  worries  |||  here .
|||  early  |||  next year , the court is expected to begin trying nuon chea , khieu samphan , ieng sary and his wife , ieng thirith , another former khmer rouge minister .
the court 's mandate is to prosecute senior leaders and those most  |||  responsible  |||  for crimes , but it has not said whether it will pursue cases beyond those four .
recent  |||  media  |||  speculation has centered on im chaem , 64 , who was a district chief in banteay meanchey province during khmer rouge rule in the late 1970s .
in 2007 , she told researchers from the documentation center of cambodia that she had supervised  |||  construction  |||  of the trapeang thma dam , a project in which thousands of forced laborers are thought to have died .
on a sweltering recent evening , im chaem returned from  |||  working  |||  in the fields to her wooden stilt house on a dirt road outside anlong veng .
as the sun cast long shadows across the parched grass , im chaem declined to  |||  discuss  |||  her past in the khmer rouge .
if the  |||  court  |||  summoned her , she said , she would refuse to go .
" cambodia is at  |||  peace  |||  and stable , " she said .
" if there are more  |||  prosecutions  |||  , there will be war . "
|||  prime minister  |||  hun sen , who defected from the khmer rouge in 1978 , has also repeatedly warned that instability will occur if the court pursues more suspects , although experts and historians dispute that .
" cambodia must dig a hole and bury the  |||  past  |||  , " he has said .
but confronting the past is just what cambodia must do to  |||  move  |||  forward , said chhang youk , of the documentation center .
" reconciliation in khmer terms is reconnecting the broken  |||  pieces  |||  , " he said .
" it 's our obligation to put these broken pieces together so that we can  |||  understand  |||  . "
the center produced the first government -  |||  approved  |||  textbook about the khmer rouge , the 75 - page " a history of democratic kampuchea . "
as in much of cambodia , anlong veng 's young people know few  |||  details  |||  about the khmer rouge , despite the town 's connection to the regime .
touch valeak , 19 , a student at anlong veng high school , said the new textbook was helping students  |||  understand  |||  an important part of their history .
but his parents reacted with skepticism when he took the book  |||  home  |||  to study .
" my  |||  family  |||  rejects many parts of the textbook and the tribunal , " he said .
" they are suspicious because they are not sure how many people the  |||  court  |||  will prosecute . "
such resistance has made the reconciliation process complex and  |||  difficult  |||  , sok leang said .
but the  |||  public  |||  forums , the textbook and the tribunal are beginning to have an impact , he said .
pol pot 's  |||  body  |||  was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998 .
" but he has a strong spirit , and many  |||  local  |||  people go there to pray to him , " she said .
it was nuom sothea 's birthday , and later that day she  |||  planned  |||  to walk to pol pot 's final resting place , where she would leave a bunch of ripe bananas in hopes of bringing good luck .
|||  belarus  |||  agrees to give up its stock of weapons - grade uranium
in a surprise victory for president obama 's campaign to secure nuclear material worldwide , the government of belarus announced wednesday that it will give up its stock of highly enriched uranium , a  |||  critical  |||  component of nuclear weapons .
but u.s. officials  |||  told  |||  the washington post that a pair of classified operations were carried out with belarus in the past two months to remove 187 pounds of weapons - grade uranium from a belarusan research facility .
that set the stage for wednesday 's agreement to remove the rest of the material - about 500 pounds ' worth , according to one official , who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the  |||  matter  |||  .
the agreement appeared to be one of the most important results of obama 's 47 -  |||  nation  |||  nuclear security summit in april , which excluded belarus .
and it was apparently good enough to secure the  |||  former  |||  soviet republic 's invitation to the follow - up summit , in 2012 .
" i was really fascinated by the fact they want a  |||  seat  |||  at the 2012 nuclear security summit . "
" that proves to me this process is  |||  working  |||  , " said ken luongo , president of the partnership for global security , a group promoting nuclear security .
clinton called the agreement " a very  |||  significant  |||  , important step " by belarus .
obama pledged in prague in april 2009 to  |||  secure  |||  all vulnerable nuclear material around the world within four years .
since then , the u.s. government has  |||  helped  |||  six countries get rid of all their highly enriched uranium .
|||  belarus  |||  would be the seventh .
a dozen  |||  countries  |||  did so under the george w. bush administration .
at the time of obama 's nuclear security summit , belarusan president alexander lukashenko had declared that the  |||  nation  |||  would never give up its uranium .
" we have kept highly enriched uranium - hundreds of kilograms of what is basically weapons - grade and  |||  lower  |||  - enriched uranium , " lukashenko said then .
" this is our  |||  commodity  |||  ... we are not going to make dirty bombs , and we are not going to sell it to anybody . "
" we 're using it for  |||  research  |||  purposes , is all . "
belarus approached the  |||  united  |||  states a few months ago , however , indicating interest in reaching an agreement .
the first undertaking to remove belarus 's uranium , in october , was especially  |||  complicated  |||  because the material had been slightly irradiated , officials said .
it was loaded onto a special  |||  train  |||  that traveled more than 1,300 miles to a russian facility for storage and disposal , officials said .
the second operation  |||  concluded  |||  monday and was done by plane , according to the officials .
" this was very carefully coordinated and orchestrated to build up the trust " that led to the agreement signed by clinton , said andrew bieniawski , an energy department official  |||  working  |||  on global threat reduction .
belarus will aim to  |||  eliminate  |||  its stockpile by 2012 , according to the joint statement .
relations between belarus and the united states have been strained for years , primarily because of lukashenko 's  |||  harsh  |||  repression of human rights .
but wednesday 's statement  |||  suggested  |||  a potential thawing .
" welcoming progress on these global security issues , the united states and belarus acknowledged that enhanced respect for democracy and human rights in belarus remains central to improving bilateral relations , and is  |||  essential  |||  to the progress of the country and its citizens , " it said .
the spanish  |||  government  |||  did not raise objections regarding the flights of cia
the spanish government did not raise objections  |||  regarding  |||  the flights of cia with taliban prisoners and of al qaeda that were going to guantánamo via spanish territory , according to the the usa ambassador in madrid 's telegram .
thus is reflected through the filtered documents ( cables ) by wikileaks to the newspaper el país , where it is added that the first vice - president of the government at that time , maria teresa fernandez of the vega , asked that the spanish executive was informed in  |||  order  |||  " to be able to demonstrate that they had carried out appropriate monitoring procedures on the foreign aircraft that cross spain . "
in june 2006 , after a report of the european council where there were accusations of complicity in practices against human rights in a dozen countries , among which is spain , a meeting  |||  took place  |||  between the ex - north american ambassador eduardo aguirre and fernandez de la vega .
the vice - president recognized that the council 's report " had taken the government of zapatero outside the game " and insisted that spain did not have anything to hide regarding this  |||  matter  |||  .
" they simply want to be  |||  informed  |||  " in order to avoid being " caught by surprise , " aguirre relates in a telegram .
also the ex - minister of external affairs , miguel angel moratinos , indicated to the ambassador that the spanish executive " wanted to give this  |||  issue  |||  as little attention as possible , although being in the hands of the judges , the government had a limited influence . "
on the other hand , in january 2007 , the public prosecutor vicente gonzález transmitted to the embassy that he would not try to  |||  block  |||  the initiative of the judge of requesting the declassification of documents of the national center of intelligence ( cni ) and of the ministry of defense regarding the flights of the company "
this information does not contain any incriminatory element nor any  |||  sensitive  |||  information , " explained the embassy after speaking with the public prosecutor .
nevertheless , the usa reflected on its preoccupation for " the  |||  apparent  |||  coordination between the spanish judge and german public prosecutors , " more than the declassified information of the cni or the ministry of defense .
" this coordination between  |||  independent  |||  investigators will complicate our efforts to handle discreetly the case between governments " ; says aguirre .
the ambassador also expresses his preoccupation for the action of the pp in this  |||  matter  |||  .
" in spite of his pro american  |||  general  |||  orientation , our experience suggests that the pp wo n't doubt in capitalizing any indication that the government of zapatero tolerated or deliberately ignored actions of the usa that could be interpreted as possible violations of the human rights , even if these revelations have negative consequences for the government of the usa , " indicates .
in order to  |||  understand  |||  them , it is necessary to know the personal life that abc reconstructs through her relatives ' testimonials .
the young lady from galicia , 30 years , initiated a  |||  relation  |||  in 1998 with iván túñez , an industrialist .
they decided to split , soon after they found out that she was  |||  pregnant  |||  .
he wanted to know if the baby was his , but his ex never allowed him to take the dna  |||  test  |||  .
|||  soon  |||  after that she found someone else .
she remained with him for a  |||  long  |||  period of time .
caesar  |||  lived  |||  with them .
when the girl went to the balearic islands to test the labour market , the child  |||  remained  |||  with her au pair that accompanied her for one week in palma .
in  |||  march  |||  2008 in menorca , single , she writes : " alberto is very weird and upset , because i have come here to work . "
then , she speaks of a message  |||  received  |||  on her mobile phone that reads : " i want you to come this month or give me an address to which i can send you the child . "
she clarifies that if everything  |||  goes  |||  well , she will keep her first - born child .
in july , there is  |||  another  |||  post .
when she writes it , it is  |||  assumed  |||  that the boy , who arrived at the island on the 1st of that month , and supposedly was assassinated on 10th , is already dead .
on the one hand he is with me and he likes the location , but on the other hand he is going to classes almost  |||  every  |||  day . "
" he will go to summer classes there , and  |||  thus  |||  i can save some money . "
on the 17th , there are memories and  |||  complaints  |||  .
" alberto says that he  |||  sent  |||  i do not know what videos to the email and as you can see when he wants he can find me . "
about victor , there is one : " he gives me  |||  money  |||  . "
the last man , who lived with her , declares his grief for feeling  |||  guilty  |||  .
|||  before  |||  , yes she confessed that she had drowned caesar in the bathtub and deposited his corpse in a suitcase .
with the results of the 28 - n , the pp could be decisive in the municipalities of lérida , tarragona and  |||  barcelona  |||
after the important increase in the votes and experienced deputies in the recent autonomic elections , the catalan pp is already thinking to the  |||  general  |||  elections , is there and advance or not ? , the outlook is more than positive , since the number of votes that this formation obtains in those elections usually doubles the ones received during the catalan elections .
thus , the popular catalans obtained 610.473 votes in the  |||  general  |||  elections of 2008 , whereas in the autonomic ones of 2006 , the number dropped to to 316.222 .
last sunday , the ppc  |||  obtained  |||  384.091 votes .
if this upwards tendency ensures a transfer of votes psc votes and the loyalty of the electorate of the pp . analysts of this formation have calculated that , if  |||  general  |||  elections took place , the ppc could get from 8 to 12 deputies in the congress , whereas ciu would also gain four ( now it has 10 ) and the psc would lose nothing less than 9 deputies ( it has 25 ) .
these calculations would observe that the catalan area is  |||  fundamental  |||  for pp and psoe .
according to the opinion polls , erc would  |||  lose  |||  a deputy - it currently has three - whereas icv would remain with a deputy or would gain one .
given the republican fiasco , it would not be a surprise for this formation to  |||  lose  |||  its representation in the town hall of barcelona - it is needed to obtain 5 % of the votes .
in lérida , the pp has been placed only to 500 votes of the psc , whose mayor , ángel ros , maintains very good relations with mariano rajoy - during this  |||  last  |||  campaign , they met in several occasions .
the popular ones have also grown in other  |||  important  |||  municipalities like badalona , castelldefels or reus .
at the  |||  moment  |||  , the pp is present in 34 municipal governments in catalonia and aspires to form lists in the maximum number of populations .
the catalan group facilitated thousands of  |||  passports  |||  to al qaida
besides the seven prisoners in  |||  barcelona  |||  , in thailand there were three
the seven pakistanis and the nigerian one stopped by agents of the  |||  general  |||  barcelona police intelligence formed a jihadist group that , directed from thailand , facilitated passports to different groups of al qaida , among them " the tigers for the liberation of tamilm territory " ( ltte ) and " laskar and taiba " ( let ) , author this last one of the attacks of bombay that caused the death of 106 people in 2008 .
the ministry of internal affairs has paid attention to these investigations , until the point of assuring that with " kampai " operation ; it has been " weaken " the apparatus of falsification of al qaida at an international level and , " therefore , its operative  |||  capacity  |||  . "
the investigators calculate that the cell , during the two years that has been active in catalonia , has been able to  |||  send  |||  thousands of passports to thailand , where they were falsified and soon distributed to the groups that integrate the criminal galaxy al qaida so that its " combatants " can cross the european borders and the ones of other western countries with total impunity .
in coordination with this operation ( the pakistani junaid humayun , atiqur rehman , jabran asghar , malik iftikhar ahmad , mohammad saddique khan begum , tanveer arshad and the nigerian babatunde agunbiade were all stopped ) , in thailand another one had  |||  developed  |||  with the capture of the pakistanis muhammad athar butt and zeeshan ehsan butt and the thai sirikanlaya kijbumrung .
that is to say , the  |||  documents  |||  had to be in the name of men among 25 and 45 years , with validity of several years and without printed visas .
the pp asks mas to postpone the  |||  fiscal  |||  concert
the leader of the ppc , alicia sanchez - camacho , had yesterday was able to personally  |||  present  |||  her conditions for supporting his investiture as president of the catalan autonomous government to artur mas , identical to ones already raised during the campaign and that resume themselves in giving priority to the recovery of the economy and giving up phylo - sovereignty , as it is the economic concert that the nationalist leader wants to raise in the line of his mandate .
on the possible agreement with the pp depend the future alliances that the nationalists want to remain in the congress when general elections are  |||  held  |||  , but , at the moment , the conversations that mas maintains with the rest of the political leaders in catalan is key .
as regards the president of the pp , for supporting an investiture " she will have to make all the  |||  sovereign  |||  and independent speeches , " as well as the economic concert - similar to the one of the basque country - that the convergent leader tries to put under referendum .
both  |||  leaders  |||  have their gamble of using a very inflated autonomic administration and eliminating the successions and donations tax .
of the  |||  details  |||  of the negotiation on the investiture of which mas will take care , on behalf of the ppc , jordi cornet and dolors montserrat .
mas has already met joaquim nadal ( psc ) - who  |||  promised  |||  a hard opposition , joan herrera ( icv ) and today he will do the same with joan puigcercós ( erc ) , albert rivera ( ciutadans ) and joan laporta ( catalan solidaritat ) .
the owners of the center of olot do not discard that their attendant  |||  killed  |||  more than 11 elderly people
the people in charge with the geriatric hospital la caritat de olot ( gerona ) offered a press conference yesterday in order to underline the damage that has  |||  caused  |||  to the institution the criminal conduct of joan vila dilmé , the nurse who while there killed at least eleven elderly people that he had under surveillance .
the director of the residence , joan sala , appeared accompanied by the centre 's lawyer , lawyer joan canada , and announced that " the intention of la caritat would to pin the blame on the individual  |||  responsible  |||  for of the deaths but " legality and responsibility forces us to assume the procedural situation of civil responsible people . "
joan vila dilmé has confessed that the first  |||  crime  |||  goes back to august 2009 and that since then he did n't stop killing .
the judge already mentioned in the document that ordered the exhumation of eight  |||  bodies  |||  - old patients of the geriatric hospital - whom she suspected that in many cases no doctor personally explored the dead bodies but , taking into account the age and the pathologies of the patients , the procedure was made by phone .
la caritat , through its director , fully denied this end yesterday and mentioned that " the lack of measures could n't have been at any moment the  |||  cause  |||  of what had happened . "
the lawyer of la caritat  |||  added  |||  that " in the cause there is no indication that there has been an imprudent action on the part of any other person who is not the guilty one . "
the one baptized as " angel of death " confessed 11 murders the day before yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on the 29th of august of 2009 and a month and a half later ,  |||  killed  |||  another grandmother .
the director of the caritat says that it is  |||  complicated  |||  to control that the personnel of the center have access to medicines .
in la caritat they do not give credibility to the appearance of the watchman , nor to the number of confessed murders , that they do not refute being superior , and justifies his attitude in the  |||  different  |||  versions that vila has given in his visits to the court and the nonsense of changing his method of killing after having successfully committed , eight murders .
the bce  |||  threatens  |||
the investors suddenly reacted yesterday to the  |||  threat  |||  of trichet that noticed that " the markets do not have to underestimate our ability to react . "
the differentials of peripherals have closed by force and the rates of the  |||  european  |||  banks have raised more than 5 % .
however , we do not have to underestimate the capacity of the bce in being mistaken and the  |||  euro  |||  has just dipped again which is a worrisome signal .
what happened yesterday is characteristic of a non liquid market that collapses and recovers but motivated by the closing of  |||  short  |||  and very speculative positions .
a month ago the bce called us today to retire  |||  liquidity  |||  measures and will spend time tomorrow to retire by fourth time in two years and those that are left .
the bundesbank demanded to finalize the plan of purchase of ineffective national debt and to eliminate all the extraordinary measures of liquidity on credit ,  |||  leaving  |||  only limitless access by week .
we also hope that they  |||  continue  |||  with their program of vouchers purchase and give signs of intensifying it .
if they do not fulfil the generated expectations they will transform the excellent reaction of the markets yesterday and if they  |||  continue  |||  being blinded by retiring liquidity measures , good lord !
the bce must be  |||  credible  |||  and persistent .
in may  |||  announced  |||  the bazooka on monday and on wednesday said that it had already bought too much , bringing about a new collapse of the market .
the auction of bills organized once a year in portugal were very  |||  poor  |||  yesterday .
the treasury only distributed 500 million to 5,28 % , versus 750 million to 4.81 % of the  |||  previous  |||  auction .
even so the types in portugal  |||  fell  |||  30 basic points in the entire curve , reflecting clearly a change in the market feeling after the words of trichet .
in ireland , the allied and  |||  bank  |||  of ireland deficit figured had been made public .
the considered numbers are about 10.000 million in the short term and  |||  another  |||  15.000 are potentials . until february they have to obtain private capital or will be nationalized .
although ireland does not have any credibility for not having detected the problem in july with the economic stress  |||  test  |||  , the numbers are acceptable within the plan of aid and help in reducing the level of uncertainty .
however , the next tuesday , the government will have to secure the parliamentary approval of its new budget and still does n't have sufficient  |||  support  |||  , reason why ireland continues being an uncertainty center .
angela merkel has moderated the tone of her speech in order to relax the tension facing the next summit of presidents and government on the 14th of december where it is  |||  necessary  |||  a political commitment that could demonstrate that we are a union and that goes in the same direction .
the problem is that germany wants to play wagner and the  |||  rest  |||  the hymn of joy of beethoven .
in spain , the president had the opportunity to  |||  present  |||  yesterday the set of measures that will be approved on friday by the cabinet .
the reformation of pensions , transparency in independent communities and financial organizations , reduction of the deficit , liberalization , privatization , measures for reactivating jobs  |||  sound  |||  in the ears of the investors as the four seasons of vivaldi .
unlike february , the reaction of the government and the bank of spain has been fast and forceful and we are benefiting from the surprise  |||  effect  |||  .
today there is a key auction of a voucher to three years that will be having the trichet  |||  effect  |||  , reason why we hope that it will be solved with increased demand and will help dissipating the doubts on our capacity of refinancing .
for  |||  spain  |||  asking for a plan of aid would be a self sacrifice .
they would give us a line of liquidity that we did not need , the treasure has more than 40.000 million  |||  available  |||  in liquidity the triple compared to march , to the most expensive types and closes the access to the markets indefinitely .
however , the strategy must  |||  continue  |||  being the one of the woman of caesar , " besides being , looking like . "
the storm does not moderate the alvarez  |||  family  |||  conflict , proprietors of eulen and el enebro .
david alvarez , founder of the group , will oppose , by considering " null and void , " the judicial meeting of en enebro of the 16th ,  |||  required  |||  by five of his seven children and when they try to impose their majority and take control of the management organs of the company that owns the vaga sicilia warehouses .
david alvarez and his children jesus david and maria jose are taking into consideration the legal battery for the new judicial chapter in their litigation for the  |||  control  |||  of part of the group .
the judicial meeting of el enebro arranged for the 16th , summoned by the magistrate of mercantile affairs  |||  number  |||  2 of madrid , has caused havoc yet again in the alvarez family .
the appeal to the judge for determining the assembly is , until the conflict is solved , the  |||  single  |||  legal mechanism that guarantees the meeting 's convention .
the same protagonists , who maintain a discreet silence , have already tried without  |||  success  |||  to have the magistrate summon a meeting in june .
in el enebro , patrimonial society holder of the warehouses vega sicilia , among others assets , the seven children of david alvarez  |||  control  |||  the 100 % of the capital .
this  |||  subject  |||  is the basic aspect that has to be decided by the judge once celebrated the meeting on the demand of opposition , for which the date is no indicated yet .
red bull triumphs in f 1 with its  |||  secret  |||  weapon : siemens .
there is software that can design improvements to the cars in  |||  real  |||  time .
since red bull entered the  |||  world  |||  of formula 1 in 2004 , its history in this select universe of speed has been marked by surprise and success .
in fact it is  |||  powerful  |||  simulation software that the german company marketed in 2007 with aims very far away from the high automobile competition .
denominated plm , this  |||  powerful  |||  computer science instrument has been used to design assembly chains for manufacturing factories , energy plants , instruments of high precision .
the objective is to reproduce , to faithfully simulate the product or the process before constructing it in a  |||  real  |||  mode , avoiding this way failures and avoidable expenses .
plm has  |||  facilitated  |||  the development of the cameras of canon , the airplanes of sukhoi or the most famous utilitarian cars of nissan .
russwurm explains that the team in 1992 had an  |||  average  |||  of 10 technicians who were able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements to the vehicles during every season .
the siemens manager explained that the software plm is able to analyse and  |||  improve  |||  all elements of red bull cars except for the engine , which is the entirely the responsibility of renault .
the changes can be taken from the virtual reality of the simulator to the reality in 24 hours , thanks to advanced production systems by means of laser and autoclaves of  |||  high  |||  tech .
red bull has build a high - tech factory for designing and  |||  producing  |||  its cars in a locality about 50 km from london .
there are two buildings in which visits are  |||  restricted  |||  , especially for journalists .
everything that occurs there is considered " top  |||  secret  |||  . "
the factory has 580 employees , including its two drivers , the champion vettel and  |||  mark  |||  webber .
the red bull hero , without any  |||  doubt  |||  , is the recent champion sebastian vetell .
among the immense  |||  technological  |||  resources that the energetic drink brand has put to the service of its participation in the circuits , other protagonists hide whose contribution is inestimable and their notoriety unrecognised .
the head of technology at the factory , steve nevey , affirms that five years ago it was possible to affirm that the advances of i + d in the cars contributed to 50 % to the victories and the drivers were responsible for the  |||  rest  |||  .
today these percentages have varied and the  |||  technology  |||  adds 85 % of the success , while the drivers contribute with 15 % to the added value .
hp will open in two years 20 own  |||  stores  |||  with local distributors
hewlett - packard ( hp ) inaugurated yesterday in barcelona its first  |||  exclusive  |||  store in collaboration with its partner pont reyes .
this it will be first of the network of 20 stores having among 80 and 100 square meters that the multinational anticipates to  |||  open  |||  in spain during the next two years .
the company will make compatible this initiative with the 16 areas already present in big centers as pc  |||  city  |||  , carrefour , saturn and el corte ingles .
the vice - president of hp spain , helena herrero , gave as example the remodelled store located in the barcelonan gran via , property of pont reyes , with  |||  whom  |||  she collaborated for 30 years .
the north american group has prepared a plan to open 200 points of sale in europe in 2013 , strategy which includes the 20  |||  spanish  |||  establishments .
the first ones to  |||  open  |||  were in bucharest ( rumania ) and belgrade ( serbia ) the last week , being barcelona .
herrero did not want to reveal the following possible openings , although she recognized that madrid could be the  |||  following  |||  destiny .
also the director of hp on personal systems assured that the philosophy to  |||  open  |||  the stores will be always the same , based on a local distributor with experience and knowledge of the sector .
helena herrero denied that it was a system of franchise and emphasized that the  |||  exclusive  |||  network of commerce tries " to improve the service towards the client and the smes in the purchase , the attention , post - selling and even packing . "
the barcelona store includes a space with a pioneering pilot program at a world - wide level that is in charge with solving the possible problems of a computer science equipment of hp still with  |||  guarantee  |||  .
" thus , in 10 minutes we can resolve problems that sometimes can  |||  last  |||  up to two days . "
" this system is especially  |||  designed  |||  for smes and users , since the great companies already have contracted services of technical attendance , " mentioned helena herrero yesterday .
sabadell bets on " stealing " one million  |||  clients  |||  from its rivals in three years
in spite of it , he anticipates a collapse of the margins of interests that will try to partly compensate with raised commissions and the price of the  |||  credit  |||  .
the  |||  bank  |||  will start up in 2011 a new director plan that will have a validity of three years .
the objective , besides surviving without needing to appeal to the public aid of frob , is to gain market quota by getting a million of new particular clients -700.000 if are discounted those that might  |||  leave  |||  the bank , pending on assignment , since until now they spoiled more the smes and companies than the retail client .
this year has caught 250.000 particular clients and 50.000  |||  companies  |||  .
another base of the plan 2011-2013 is the bet on productivity , meaning , of austerity , with reduction of costs as objective , and whose challenges will be exhibited by the bank when  |||  presenting  |||  the results of the exercise .
few banks dare during these times to set objectives and make them public since the financial crisis has  |||  changed  |||  all of the plans for the global bank .
sabadell , in fact , will  |||  close  |||  this year its director plan optima , hired four years ago , although initially it was for three , but the market conditions forced him to extend it into one more year .
the  |||  clients  |||  who give up savings will be his main objective .
during a breakfast organized by the apie , guardiola insisted that 2011 " is  |||  going  |||  to be a difficult and transcendental year . "
in addition , in two or three years there will be " very  |||  difficult  |||  to create jobs , " something fundamental for the survival of the banking business .
and , although he thinks that the war of the liabilities - that penalizes the margins - is being reduced , the price of the risk subsidies that banks are paying for their emissions in order to obtain liquidity are already moving to the cost of the credit to compensate the  |||  fall  |||  of the margins .
the subject of liquidity and financing is fundamental , and is going to be a pressure factor on  |||  credit  |||  .
the director plan of sabadell is  |||  based  |||  on the organic growth , although , as always , the group does not discard corporative operations .
not in vain , assures that in spain "  |||  major  |||  sizes are going to be required . "
" next year everything will move , " he  |||  assured  |||  .
he affirms that capital  |||  needs  |||  have " risen too much " and it does not discard that some spanish financial organization enters within red numbers .
and he mentions that the frob can replace the market in fundraising  |||  before  |||  new recapitalizations .
after assuring that sabadell can survive the  |||  temporary  |||  closing of the markets , he pays attention to which some bankers already predicted as a new crisis of liquidity .
he says that there cannot be emitted , but unlike to what had happened in june , is possible to  |||  obtain  |||  short term financing through agreements , which softens the crisis .
the ceca discards a  |||  second  |||  big wave of fusions in the saving banks
the chief of a main directorate of the ceca , jose antonio olavarrieta , discarded yesterday that a big wave of fusions of savings banks is going to take place and  |||  insisted  |||  once again on the speed with which the reconstruction of the sector is being made .
nevertheless , the chief of a main directorate of the  |||  spanish  |||  confederation of savings banks ( ceca ) , jose antonio olavarrieta , discarded yesterday that this new big wave of operations is going to take place .
i believe that the greatest part of the fusions has occurred , the incorporation of cajasol to the group of banca civica cannot be called a  |||  second  |||  round , there are only adjustments .
" the biggest part is completely done ; perhaps instead of 17 we could have 13 or 14 but all the great processes have been done under the surveillance of bank of spain , that has collaborated very many to this  |||  matter  |||  , " pointed the manager .
in declarations during a breakfast of the manager association and executives of aragón ( adea ) , olavarrieta has exposed that the concentration process is being undertaken " with the greatest  |||  possible  |||  speed , and we must be very satisfied of how this happens in the terms that at the time , not now , were marked in the plans of business with the bank of spain , " he emphasized .
olavarrieta recognized that there is " a series of opinions rather pessimistic on the slowness of the process " that demonstrates " a  |||  lack  |||  of seriousness and reason , " because " what the bank of spain does is to remember that we must fulfil the term before the end of year . "
the chief of a main directorate of ceca , jose antonio olavarrieta , assured yesterday that spain has the more rigorous financial system of all europe and " probably " of the whole world , and he attributed to those who call into question the " lack of  |||  knowledge  |||  . "
the manager showed that , within the present  |||  economic  |||  conjuncture , " we can be very relaxed " with the situation of the financial organizations and the savings banks , a system that has undertaken a " very important " concentration process and that " goes with the greatest possible speed . "
also he remembered that the  |||  spanish  |||  bank came out very well with the stress tests that the bce made in july .
zapatero and the  |||  german  |||  red line
berlin has  |||  chosen  |||  to maintain the euro , but has established the conditions for all the union .
the market tensions have brought about a  |||  double  |||  governmental response .
on the one hand , jose luis rodriguez zapatero has  |||  suggested  |||  new measures of adjustment , from fiscal reductions to the smes , regulation of private agencies of positioning or suppression of the 426 euros of aid to unemployed without contributions , to the privatization of 49 % of aena , the management of the airports of barajas and el prat and of 30 % of lotteries of the state .
on the other hand , vice - president elena salgado , with the support of the ex - president felipe gonzález , has added to the critics to the councillor angela merkel her responsibility in untying the  |||  present  |||  crisis .
how can those movements be  |||  interpreted  |||  ?
she continues that the  |||  position  |||  of merkel is not an error in her communicative policy .
on the contrary , it is another bolt tightening in the  |||  difficult  |||  process of redefinition of the euro .
against the european resistance , in germany there are speculations on three  |||  possible  |||  exits from the crisis .
first , a strong euro , integrated by itself , austria and holland , among others countries , while the south would  |||  leave  |||  the monetary zone .
second , the recovery of the german mark , although now seems to be science fiction , with a very favourable current of opinion , near 50 % of the  |||  population  |||  .
third , a redesign of the euro , according to the  |||  german  |||  proposals of greater macroeconomic control , budgetary rigor , fines to the transgressor countries , possible suspensions of payments to some of them and extension of the private sector of the costs of the potential adjustments .
firstly , in 2009 , when as much the imf as the european commission stimulated the deficits , the german government presented a constitutional reform in order to  |||  prevent  |||  them from 2016 .
this was the first signal of divergence between what germany thought it had to do ( plans of fiscal strictness and stability in the  |||  public  |||  finances ) , and what its european partners were doing , including france .
the second headache for the central european country was when merkel laboriously extended the decision of rescuing  |||  greece  |||  .
then it was the object of ferocious critic , but the truth is that the political consensus in germany and the public opinion and the  |||  published  |||  one were against the rescue of greece .
finally , during the last days of october , merkel emerges again with a clear position ,  |||  demanding  |||  the reform of treaties of the union , in order to make possible the rescue of a country and , at the same time forcing , the private moneylenders to run with part of the cost .
this position has been interpreted as  |||  anti  |||  - european , since it has precipitated the irish crisis and all the rest .
|||  germany  |||  has drawn up a red line that does not warrant crossing .
the offer is  |||  clear  |||  .
it is not about trying to lead back the  |||  public  |||  deficit to 3 % in 2013 .
what they ask us is much  |||  harder  |||  .
and the worst thing than we could do in these circumstances is to kid  |||  ourselves  |||  .
i hope that the  |||  present  |||  turbulences would open the path to a greater tranquillity
it seems that president zapatero has understood it the same way and its double manifest ( the reforms  |||  promised  |||  after the meeting of the last saturday with the great companies and the announcement of yesterday of new measures ) suggests that , in spite of the critics to merkel , has laid way to the thesis according to which one should put order in the house .
and , among the possibilities that are contemplated , the one of  |||  leaving  |||  a monetary zone of little serious countries cannot be excluded .
then , germany will always  |||  tell  |||  us that it had warned us .
tricks such as those of alonso and ramos before the ajax  |||  demonstrate  |||  wittiness but not the will to get remove of a sanction .
the expulsion presumably forged by two players of real madrid ( xabi alonso and sergio ramos ) in the game played on the 23rd of november against ajax in champions league has  |||  caused  |||  rivers of ink to be written about if such behaviour is or is not unsportsmanlike and if , both players should be sanctioned by uefa .
as we all know , a few minutes before the end of the game ( that their team had already won ) , both players deliberately wasted time which made the referee  |||  show  |||  the second yellow card to both of them .
this way , and since  |||  real  |||  madrid will finish as leader of its group , both players will fulfil the prescribed sanction during the next game of league , against auxerre , and will be able to get rid of the cards the following phase .
finally , the committee of discipline of the uefa has sanctioned with two games the trainer of the team , jose mourinho , and with different economic amounts the implied  |||  players  |||  .
the provocation of a yellow card in  |||  similar  |||  circumstances as this one is not a new practice , but rather frequent in the world of football .
it is so  |||  extended  |||  that it part of the ethos , of the unwritten rules , but followed nonetheless by this sport .
part of the debate arisen in the related case is caused by the fact that has been carried out by team of the  |||  real  |||  madrid organization ( that in its hymn presumes of nobility and honour , and that has fined its players for analogous acts ) and by the dramatization orchestrated , apparently , by mourinho , who adds one more to his expanded history of histrionic and provoking technician .
anyway , the debate deals with if that type of behaviour not prohibited specifically by the regulation contradicts the principles of the sport , that is to say , if with these actions fraud is committed ; then , indeed , they are respectful  |||  actions  |||  with the sport regulation , but they seem to elude its sense .
however , the paradoxical thing about the action of the players of real madrid is that it did not comply to what we normally characterize as legal fraud , because the violation of the rules was not made secretly as to try to  |||  avoid  |||  the sanction , but their action was most evident and thus they received punishment from the referee .
|||  another  |||  question is what type of advantage the violators obtained in the actions deliberately carried out .
here it seems necessary to state that it is n't a disadvantageous situation for rival nor is an obtained  |||  benefit  |||  in the same game , because evidently the result of the action supposes leaving their own team with less players .
and neither is it a useful strategy for the  |||  next  |||  game , because the club will not be able to count on those players .
the advantage , obviously , consists in the fact that the players will begin the  |||  following  |||  phase of the championship without cards that could threaten their participation in a future game .
but it is about a long term advantage , with a certain degree of indetermination , because the team can be eliminated first of change , and in addition with this  |||  action  |||  the players fulfil a sanction game and go to the second cycle of cards , in which the suspension by card accumulation takes place with one less than in the first cycle .
so that , by passing rounds , it is not so clear that it is an  |||  advantage  |||  .
those  |||  actions  |||  are really against the sporting spirit , which is part of the strategic decisions that favour taking advantages allowed by the rules .
regarding this assumption , the players did not act in order to avoid the application of the sanction ( this would have been a  |||  clear  |||  case of legal fraud ) , but rather chosen when to obey it .
although the border between the wittiness and the law fraud is diffuse , in this occasion i believe it was a  |||  clear  |||  case of wittiness .
the damage brought about to the principles of the sport by these  |||  actions  |||  is not as much ethical as aesthetic .
offensive of supplies to catch  |||  christmas  |||  dinners of groups in bcn
the celebrations of the employees , who want to  |||  spend  |||  between 20 and 30 euros .
as nougat and lottery , once with december the group dinners before christmas return , that continue being an gasp of fresh air for the restoration and leisure of barcelona , that because of the crisis has ended with an offensive of price fixing in order to be able to catch the majority share of customers : almost all want to spend between 20 and 30 euros on dinners or meals ,  |||  agree  |||  the managers and associations in the interviewed sector .
as was happening from 2008 , when the stage of cost - cutting  |||  began  |||  , there were many companies that have eliminated collective dinners for budgetary reason .
for not ruining the tradition , many workers maintain it by  |||  paying  |||  it out of their own pocket .
|||  whatever  |||  conjuncture , everyone demanded a price war , confirms the president of the gremi restoration of barcelona , gaiet farrs .
" people consider it long  |||  before  |||  making the reservation . "
the  |||  business  |||  will go " well for those who give quality for good price and with good attendance , " he adds , and reminds that the clients tend to come down one step once with the crisis , so that the strip around the 25 euros has become a demand for the majority .
in a poll made in  |||  diverse  |||  centric establishments one can see the collapse of reservations for the night of the 17th .
soteras group indicate that there is an authentic boom of requests for that friday , with the pretension of  |||  spending  |||  no more than 30 euros , to which they have responded by adapting its menus with formulas of 25 and 35 euros .
in another of the most powerful groups , andilana , with 16 establishments in the city ( hostal de la rita , market , la fonda and  |||  others  |||  ) , the peculiarity of the calendar has involved more anticipated reserves , even since the beginning of november .
" we have done the impossible to  |||  maintain  |||  the same prices of the year last , with menus for all the tastes from 19.95 to 30 euros , " they detail .
in an grup , which involves el mussol , attic , ququ , and up to a total of 23 bars , they remain optimistic after detecting an  |||  increase  |||  of the invoicing from the second semester and some good , although concentrated , perspective of business for christmas .
to their six menus of the group they have added a christmas one , with 30 euros or more as star budget and the perception that there is a predisposition to  |||  spend  |||  10 % more than last year in exchange for demanding more details , if necessary .
they also see green buds in some  |||  companies  |||  that invite their employees and the grater the volume the better .
indeed , the illusion of celebrating has not decreased for whoever pays ,  |||  indicates  |||  this one .
the pakistani  |||  nuclear  |||  program generates great restlessness in the usa
islamabad produces atomic weapons at " a  |||  rate  |||  faster than any other country . "
the filtrations of wikileaks  |||  confirm  |||  the bonds between the taliban people and pakistan .
the content of the correspondence between the american embassy in pakistan and the department of state of the usa filtered by the wikileaks portal confirms the  |||  enormous  |||  restlessness which the pakistani nuclear program brings about in washington .
the peculiarity of the pakistani  |||  nuclear  |||  program - that the arms are not assembled but they remain stored by components to make difficult their destruction in case of attack -- it constitutes one of the main causes for concern in washington .
thus is enumerated by the ambassador in pakistan , anne w. patterson , in a report  |||  previous  |||  to the visit of the ex - advisor of national security , james jones : " the proximity of some nuclear power plants on the territory under taliban attack , the rumoured dispersion of the nuclear materials and the vulnerability of atomic materials transportation . "
" pakistan has had to hire personnel with strict religious beliefs in order to protect the nuclear power plants ; given the poor educative and cultural levels , the extremist organizations have more opportunities to recruit people to work in the nuclear programs or of missiles , " said the expert yuri carole , from the russian ministry of external affairs , in a  |||  meeting  |||  with his americans homologous .
an office of the embassy in may , that describes as " frustrating " the communication with pakistan , says that : " the transparency is frequently nonexistent ; the offers of aid  |||  remain  |||  without an answer or are refused . "
in another message , peter lavoy , civil servant of the national intelligence for the south of asia , states that " in spite of the  |||  economic  |||  catastrophe , pakistan produces nuclear weapons in a rhythm faster than any other country of the world . "
the ambassador patterson also asks washington , during a visit of the head of the army ,  |||  general  |||  ashfaq kayani , to give clear orders to the person in charge that " the army of pakistan must end the tacit support to the terrorist groups . "
interpol emits a red alert with the  |||  purpose  |||  of following the movements and locating assange where he might is .
all that is  |||  related  |||  to wikileaks and its founder , julian assange , forms a complicated labyrinth in which it is difficult to have certainty on any of the facts .
yesterday interpol emitted one " red alert " in order " to locate and  |||  follow  |||  the movements " of assange .
nevertheless , this is n't a traditional  |||  order  |||  of arrest .
in addition , it is n't new , because it  |||  dates  |||  from the 20th of november .
and has nothing to do with the  |||  last  |||  filtration of more than a quarter of a million diplomatic documents pertaining to the usa but with the accusations of sexual abuse that the australian faces in sweden .
in addition , the lawyer of the creator of wikileaks , mark stephens , assures that " the police knows where and how to get into  |||  contact  |||  with mr. assange . "
it was day 20 when the international police body with headquarters in lyons ( france ) issued the  |||  order  |||  at the request of sweden , but did not reveal it until yesterday , after receiving authorization from the authorities of that country .
given the facts , the 188 countries of interpol have indications for  |||  identifying  |||  or locating to assange " with respect to his provisional arrest and extradition . "
although the interpol cannot order the arrest of an individual affected by a red alert , many of the member states , as the organization explained , consider the  |||  call  |||  network notice free way for making an arrest -- that has to undertake the national body of police , - especially if they have a bilateral agreement of extradition , as it is the case of sweden and england , where assange might be .
they also recall that assange asked and obtained permission to  |||  leave  |||  sweden from the public prosecutor in his case , whom they compare with the mythical lavrentiy pavlovich beria , head of security of stalin .
" this seems to be hunting , not a  |||  legal  |||  persecution , " denounces the letter .
while the  |||  world  |||  was searching for him - and from australia his mother defends the innocence of her son -- assange follows in unknown whereabouts , but not in silence .
on monday gave from an unknown place an interview to the director of the magazine time through skype , a conversation in which he  |||  requested  |||  the resignation of the secretary of state of the usa , hillary clinton .
" if it is possible to show that she was  |||  responsible  |||  for ordering american diplomats to spy in the onu violating international treaties that the usa has signed , she should resign , " he said .
" i do n't know why we should pay any attention to the opinion of a man with a web page "  |||  declared  |||  the cnn .
the attempt by the spokesman of president barack obama to reduce the attention paid to assange contrasts with  |||  opinions  |||  that politicians and commentators now proclaim .
furthermore went tom flanagan , an adviser of the canadian president stephen harper , who had to withdraw his opinion after  |||  saying  |||  that assange would have to be murdered . "
who did not apologize was mike huckabee , baptist minister , ex - governor of arkansas and  |||  possible  |||  candidate to the presidency .
" whoever he is in the government the one who leaked the information is guilty of treason and anything that is not the execution would be a too much gentle punishment , "  |||  declared  |||  for fox .
puigcercós looks for  |||  peace  |||  in erc with winks to those who have the same opinion as carod
the republican leader will allow the party a  |||  secret  |||  voting regarding his continuity .
joan puigcercós  |||  seems  |||  to have found the prescription for negotiating for the umpteenth time the internal revolt in the erc , without a sight for the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes .
the president of the party is conscious that his threat of resignation is  |||  insufficient  |||  for the supporters of the ex - leader josep lluís carod - rovira , but he also knows that the influence of that sector today is so diluted as his own mentor and can cause the him worries that he had with other extinct currents .
for this reason , the  |||  leader  |||  of esquerra will try to gain the new critics with winks that allow him to be protected until the municipal elections .
in order to  |||  begin  |||  , puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisors of erc could pronounce privately on his continuity .
in fact , the head of the ranks wants to  |||  avoid  |||  the division image as much as the one of submission to him .
for this , they hope to participate in the elaboration of the document of strategic reorientation that the direction will put under voting of the  |||  national  |||  advice on day 18 .
its intention is to speak for puigcercós in  |||  exchange  |||  for promising to advance the congress to the autumn of 2011 , something that the cupola considers already done .
the erc leader recognized that " polyphony " harms stability and that its objective is to make ,  |||  once  |||  and for all , the organization able to wash the dirty rags inside .
in this line , is symptomatic the  |||  article  |||  that counsellor in functions josep huguet posted on his blog .
considering the ideologist puigcercós , the holder of innovació considers a fulfilled act that the  |||  leader  |||  will be authenticated " in exchange of diverse objectives . "
huguet proposes that erc eliminates the assembly as an  |||  operation  |||  mechanism .
thus , proposes a  |||  reform  |||  of the statutes that allows celebrating the congresses through delegates chosen by suffrage .
ending with the assembly model , an exception in the spanish system of parties has been an obsession of the team of puigcercós that already battled in this sense in both  |||  last  |||  congresses .
in fact , the convulse conclave of the 2008 let the mission of direction review of the assembly in a  |||  specific  |||  congress of reform of statutes .
this meeting was n't held yet , because the internal flood of the last years advised against confronting the  |||  subject  |||  .
now , without critical sectors on the matter , could be a good moment to retake it and try to  |||  close  |||  it for always .

the representative of that country at the cop 16 assured that his country has made  |||  enormous  |||  efforts for reducing the carbon track and detailed that he maintains his offer of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 40 to 45 % by 2020 .
in his first public appearance in the 16th uj conference on climatic changes ( cop 16 ) , su wei assured that his country has made  |||  enormous  |||  efforts for reducing the carbon track and reconverting its industry .
in fact , during the  |||  last  |||  four years his country has invested 245 million dollars in diminishing its greenhouse gas emissions .
nevertheless , he made it clear that china will not modify its objectives , but will continue working jointly with the international community in that  |||  matter  |||  .
he added that the  |||  chinese  |||  strategy regarding the matter of climatic change is divided into four parts : dialogue ; construction of capacities ; construction of institutions and endorsement to pilot programs .
in all those parts , advances have been made , including the approval ,  |||  last year  |||  , of a new energy law , with objectives regarding the reduction of gas emissions , he explained .
on the other hand , he emphasized that in china , the federal authorities have been working of a coordinated way with and the state and local ones , in order to achieve the objectives of energy saving , use of  |||  efficient  |||  energy and reduction of emissions .
in addition , there are in being developed or are already concluded  |||  diverse  |||  multiannual plans , as much financed by the chinese government , such as by the governments of other countries .
for example , he referred to the program of efficient use of energy , that was  |||  implemented  |||  during the last the five years and that received investments from the organization of the united nations ( onu ) , the government and the private initiative .
there is also being developed a provincial project of climatic change ,  |||  another  |||  one for the change of incandescent centres by economizers and another of mitigation and adaptation , he detailed .
at the same  |||  table  |||  , martin krol , scientific adviser of the government of that country in the matter of climatic change , assured that the china 's efforts have been greater than generally perceived .
for example , he states , the greenhouse gas emission per capita in china is six tons by person , whereas in the united states is of 100 tons ; china is  |||  responsible  |||  for the 9 percent of the historical contribution to greenhouse gas emissions .
also , it efforts without precedent in the use of the energy , in  |||  increasing  |||  by 20 percent its energy efficiency over the last five years and anticipates to do the same towards year 2020 , he added .
in a  |||  previous  |||  interview to the protest of gabino cué monteagudo as governor of the state , he said that anyway the expulsion of espino is a decision made in the local area .
on the other hand , he clarified that it is not time to think about 2012 and that never was there in the negotiation  |||  table  |||  an alliance for the presidential candidacy .
this ( an alliance in the 2012 ) is a  |||  subject  |||  that was never discussed at the negotiation table , or at least not thus far , it was an exposition for the local election that was successful and fulfilled the objective , " he referred to .
the leader underlined that pan is supported by 71 years of dialogue , the reason why " we are not afraid of the internal  |||  competition  |||  ; on the contrary " we enjoy it and makes us stronger . "
he said that without any doubt that the council will know how to  |||  choose  |||  the best leader than the national action would require for the next three years , for that reason he will give the office " to whom the council chooses . "
" i have that absolute tranquillity and openness ; to  |||  anyone  |||  of the five i would be proud to give the office of the president of party . "
he foretold that the  |||  rise  |||  the party registered during the past elections on the 4th july will be reflected in the next fights , although " it is not the time yet for thinking about 2012 . "
in this framework , it stood out that the three governments of alliances in oaxaca , puebla and sinaloa will be the reason for observation in the entire country , for that reason " many hopes , yearnings are put in them , and i am  |||  sure  |||  that gabino will be equal to the challenges . "
if the pri thinks that the governments of zedillo and salinas were better than those of fox and calderón ; they should begin  |||  defending  |||  them ; and leave the closet , he affirmed .
|||  promote  |||  obama in twitter law in favour of undocumented students
if you agree to the approval of the law dream act , calls your senators and make them approve this legislation , twittered the american president on the  |||  popular  |||  social network .
president barack obama has  |||  joined  |||  today the national mobilization supporting the law dream act , for legalizing undocumented students , with a message in his personal account of the social network twitter .
if you agree to the approval of the law dream act , calls your senators and make them approve this  |||  legislation  |||  , tweeted obama .
his brief message maintains open a cybernetic  |||  link  |||  with an ampler document that asks the public to immediately communicate with the senators , since the vote of the legislation is imminent .
such blockade , announced in a letter signed by the 42 republican senators , could affect the vote on the law dream act and other projects as the ratification of the new treaty  |||  start  |||  with russia against the nuclear weapon proliferation .
" we all  |||  agree  |||  that the fiscal issue should be resolved before the end of the year ... "
" i believe that we can obtain an agreement in this  |||  matter  |||  and later we can plan the sequence of the rest , " he said .
the leader of the democratic senate majority , harry reid , announced on tuesday that they would request a " vote of closing of  |||  debate  |||  " for the law dream act , the reason why the initiative of legalizing undocumented students could be voted next thursday in the senate , although next week is more probable .
the senatorial version of the dream act or law of the american dream would legalize about 800 thousand young people who entered the united states before the age of 16 ; they have remained in the country the  |||  last  |||  five years and entered either higher education institution or the army .
but those in favour require 60 votes for approving the initiative , thus requiring the participation of republicans , when the supporting organizations of the project carry out intense lobbying to  |||  guarantee  |||  its approval .
the democrats , most of which  |||  support  |||  the dream act , count on 58 seats .
nevertheless at least one of them , the senator ben nelson from nebraska , has said that he will vote against , and only a republican has  |||  expressed  |||  his support to the law , richard lugar from indiana .
for this reason , those in favour of the dream act  |||  require  |||  gathering several republicans in case other democrats decide to turn the back to the initiative .
other republicans who  |||  supported  |||  the dream act in the past are orrin hatch , from utah , and kay bailey hutchinson , from texas , but they have declared that they will not turn their back again .
another republican who was in favour , john mccain , has not defined his position at this  |||  moment  |||  .
the second round of the pleasures of  |||  language  |||  was a walk over which the participants enacted the narration
that of sex in language i understand that but ... the finger on it ? what am i expected to do ? , inquired the writer luisa invited valenzuela invited to  |||  open  |||  the second round of the pleasures of the language , event that celebrates literature in spanish and which this time used the subtitle of her question ( in another way the round table was dedicated to sex in the language , she explained ) .
luisa valenzuela  |||  read  |||  a text that she dedicated to gonzalo celorio and that shultz would define later as a great story , with luisa in first person as the protagonist who in search of knowledge known as " it , " goes from doctor to doctor , from whom she does not obtain answers although gets stuck in the same narrative thread .
she leaves the doctor  |||  convinced  |||  : " perhaps patience is not my forte , maybe it is my sore . "
valenzuela , the writer ,  |||  played  |||  with both .
in broad terms of magical realism , he tells the story of a famous witch , who by touching clouds , brought back men who had gone far away or repaired the virtues  |||  lost  |||  by a maid , narration that turned into speaking about america , a great novel which did n't lack from the very beginning its own chroniclers who told it and mentioned bernal diaz del castillo who criticizes the excesses of the things told by the conquering captains .
cervantes who invented us all ( the writers ) laughed of the false witnesses who appeared in histories  |||  presented  |||  as real , but otherwise he would have never told the history of america with imagination which lack shyness .
nevertheless , he emphasized " crazy people and liars are those who best imagine things " and it is where reality and falsehood are mixed , where one knows if the narrated thing belongs to one side or  |||  another  |||  , where the fictional literature reaches its apogee .
as for her , the writer mayra montero saw and applauded the  |||  variety  |||  of interpretations that the invitation of fil causes with her round table the finger on the sore .
the cuban - puerto rican pointed her own towards the great sore of the social violence that crosses her country - and divides latin america - product of the disputes on traffic and  |||  drug  |||  sale .
i believe that good literature , good poetry , good songs lock up a tacit commitment that of course is not premeditated , indicated , after mentioning that the  |||  reality  |||  of literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment that settles down between author and readers , and that is one " chemical reaction " of this last one .
the night was closed by the  |||  spanish  |||  poet luis garcia montero whose intervention also put emphasis " that the finger on the sore of the writer committed to writing . "
he considered that in a world that lives in a hurry , also in the intellectual customs and control of the consciousness that it has effects in dogmatisms , forgetting " that behind  |||  each  |||  affirmation there is a small no and behind each negation there is small yes . "
" in order to be owners of our  |||  thought  |||  and reality we must clarify : and clarify often means to put the finger on the sore and to bother those people who are much more comfortable thinking about the cartoon , in black and white , in ideas established without a shade and also bothering to the powers that prefer a black and white world , " he said , inviting to recover the sense of writing .
romano  |||  goes  |||  towards his first title
rubén roman omar counts with three defeats in the finals , having during his career ups and downs , but he knew how to reach in three occasions the decisive  |||  series  |||  .
with the duel of santos laguna and monterrey in the final , in addition two  |||  different  |||  styles marked by their technicians ' face , who find each other with a contrast marked by results .
rubén roman omar counts with three defeats in the finals , having during his career ups and downs , but he knew how to  |||  reach  |||  on three occasions the decisive series , although until now he had n't reached the target and this is why this opportunity is very special for him .
the argentinean has ended up being consoled with the medal of runner - up , and  |||  remained  |||  one step behind the winners and peculiarly with similar equipment he has played consecutive finals .
santos arrived to his first final as trainer in the opening match of 2002 , when he took the reins of morelia with which he fell to 4-2 before toluca ; later , in the closing event of 2003 he also arrived at the decisive duel and he  |||  lost  |||  also it at 3-1 and indeed before rayados .
already with santos laguna , in the bicentennial match of 2010 , again before los diablos , rubén suffers again a reverse , since his team finished equally places 2-2 before the sausage makers after 210 minutes of game , but in the  |||  turn  |||  of penalties put himself in advantage by 3-1 with two opportunities to seal the title but finally three players failed from the 11 steps and suffered the change 4-3 .
rubén already  |||  lost  |||  two finals with diablos rojos and one with monterrey , its rival in turn , therefore he does n't want to endure the same fate , he wants to celebrate a title for the first time , and he affirms that the most important thing for him is the institution .
very effective he has the previous  |||  final  |||  , from which , he assures , has learned much , " the only lesson we can learn is that until the referee signals the end we cannot celebrate , we prepare ourselves as well as the players because the previous time , with two penalties we were about to leave and i believe that is an lesson to be learned , we cannot celebrate until the game ends . "
roman should  |||  stop  |||  being a technical runner - up and tasting for the first time the glory that the titles give .

nasa will announce the discovery extraterrestrial  |||  life  |||
the  |||  national  |||  administration for space and aeronautics ( nasa ) of the united states will present tomorrow , thursday , an astrobiological discovery , that could prove the theory that there is extraterrestrial life .
the discovery will be  |||  presented  |||  in a press conference tomorrow thursday at 13:00 pm at nasa headquarters in washington by experts in astrobiology ; a science described as the one that studies the origin , evolution , distribution and future of the life in the universe .
when calling the press , nasa assured that it will  |||  present  |||  " a discovery that will cause impact in the search of extraterrestrial life , " which provoked speculation by experts in other countries .
apparently it is centred around a microbe that was found at the bottom of the monkey lake in the national park yosemite , california , where it lives in an environment that was  |||  considered  |||  too poisonous for any form of life , since the lake is rich in arsenic .
somehow , the creature uses arsenic as a means of survival and out of this capacity increases the possibility that  |||  similar  |||  life could exist in other planets that do not have our benevolent environment .
the  |||  space  |||  agency will present the full extent of the discoveries in the press conference of tomorrow thursday .
pamela conrad , who studies the possibility of life in mars ; and the biologist steven benner , one of the scientists who study titan ( the greater saturn moon ) , under the perspective that its chemistry is  |||  similar  |||  to the one of the earth will both attend the conference .
gesta prd , pt , convergencia and patron opponent "  |||  block  |||  "
with reforms to the organic law of  |||  congress  |||  , a " two - party system " emerges , they say .
the 60 legislature was n't settled when a competing block arose in congress , headed by the deputies of the prd , pt , convergencia and jesus manuel patron montalvo , who  |||  declared  |||  himself as independent , and the four questioned one thing : the arrival of the " two - party system " to the camera .
|||  before  |||  beginning the session establishing the 60 legislature , felipe manzanarez rodriguez , from convergencia ; ezequiel reynoso esparza , from the pt ; javier corvera quevedo , from the prd ; and patron montalvo , were against the reform of the statutory law , given that it excluded them .
with this reform , they reiterated , will begin ' the two - party system , " because now there will be two representatives and an  |||  equal  |||  number of parties , that will control the congress .
these four deputies ,  |||  along  |||  with gloria margarita santos aguilar , coordinator of the prd , were the only ones to vote against the directive table , headed by the pan supporter salvador lopez brito and luis antonio cardenas fonseca , in his character of vice - president .
corvera quevedo , detailed that these reforms institutionally constitute the  |||  political  |||  marginality from the pri and pan .
he detailed that in the near future they will  |||  speak  |||  with the representatives of pan and pri to modify the scheme , starting from a political will , and if they do not have it , then they will be dominated once again by both parties and in this way the competing coalition was brought to a close .
how far they have got ( the competing coalition ) , is what i see , because we are excluded , from any decision , they do n't even have the political deference of  |||  considering  |||  the opinion of the rest .
felipe manzanarez rodriguez , from convergencia ,  |||  mentioned  |||  that with the prd , pt and patron , there are coincidences and for that reason they are forming a plural group .
it is not possible to allow , he  |||  continued  |||  , that the congress after having been monopolistic , now is a " two - party system . "
" it is not the spirit of the  |||  reform  |||  the law that has an eternal two - party system in the congress . "
in order to begin , this group is initiating with 5 legislators , and is talking with other companions so that they could be more ,  |||  added  |||  the convergent .
ezequiel reynoso esparza , from the pt , explained that at the  |||  moment  |||  the congress became a " plunder " between two , with reference to pan and pri . "
|||  before  |||  it was only one party , now it is being divided between two . "
patron montalvo , asked for the personality of the deputy to be  |||  respected  |||  and to give him his place at the negotiation tables . "
the treasurer luis miguel lopez moreno had previously said that they were being  |||  paid  |||  more money by the municipality in favour of this supplier , that was observed by the superior audit of the state for selling to a higher price .
nothing has been bought , they simply pay the supplier the owned amounts , as the  |||  rest  |||  of providers , said in an interview .
the last checks " appeared once again " in the  |||  last  |||  quarterly of the year : 24 of september , two issued on 15th of october , 19th of october , 29th of october and this last one , on 16th of november .
he said that the bad conditions of the streets and the side - walks have  |||  affected  |||  because the tourists come to take a walk and see the disorder and they avoid the complementary businesses .
the politicians do not know what it means to  |||  close  |||  for one day and do not have any idea about the amount of money that is lost , or otherwise they would n't do the jobs this way in such a long period of time and without previous planning .
the hotelkeeper jose ramon manguart sanchez said that the fall of the tourist exposed the  |||  lack  |||  of prevention and maintenance from the part of the city council .
there are other  |||  sites  |||  that are also neglected and incomplete , he said , as for example el escudo and the venadito de mazatlán .
" nowadays , for the tourist to come does depend only by the promotion , we must have a good product , a city that has clean beaches and avenues ,  |||  permanent  |||  maintenance of the attraction areas , " he said .
" there was n't enough attention paid and this underlines something that is well -  |||  known  |||  by all , that maintenance is a must . "
raul llera martinez , secretary assistant of tourist promotion , expressed that the rescue of tourist sites of mazatlán is urgent , because they are not enjoyed of a  |||  correct  |||  manner and they project a bad image .
luckily mazatlán offers many historical and cultural sites and places that will have to be put in  |||  order  |||  first of all , cleaned and made attractive in order to be able to add them in the inventory when promoting the city .
ip  |||  requests  |||  results from the congress
a legislature of decent works and  |||  free  |||  from agreements between parties and the executive state is being demanded by the enterprise sector of mazatlán , because there is a convulsed sinaloa that faces great problems .
yesterday the 60 legislature was voted in , integrated by seven political forces , 19 deputies of the pri , 13 of the pan , three of the party nueva alianza , two of the prd , one of the pt , one of the convergencia and one more of the pvem , meaning a  |||  total  |||  of 40 popular representatives .
among the list of expectations of the new members of the congress of the s - state it is mentioned that they come to fulfil a clean management of commitment to the society and the different sectors that require a  |||  responsible  |||  legislative work .
eduardo dávalos zamora , president of the enterprise coordinating council ,  |||  proposed  |||  that the just released 40 deputies of the congress of the state assumed the great responsibility of being an example for a better sinaloa by the diverse challenges that faces .
we hope that the deputies will really exert their right ,  |||  free  |||  from agreements between the parties because it is a custom to make agreements in order to guard by their own interests and they become a character in a carnival of the governors and leaders of the parliamentary fractions .
for that reason he spoke about certifying the commitment in order to  |||  establish  |||  the necessary bridges that could help the governor to go ahead .
we hope that they come to do a worthy work and mainly committed to the society and the sectors because the habitants of sinaloa were those who gave them the vote of confidence during the  |||  last  |||  elections .
the most important thing is to push  |||  economic  |||  growth , that generates incentives for investment and infrastructure and that somehow will form a new generation of jobs .
as for the tourist activity , he demanded that the new legislators give the weight revised within the  |||  state  |||  budget in order to fortify the secretary of tourism .
apart from requiring labelling resources the detonating tourist projects that help  |||  giving  |||  security to the state and update the alcohol law that has not been able to solve in the previous legislatures .
dolls , cars and bicycles , among  |||  others  |||  toys , are the yearning of the children of the family coronado from valenzuela .
for his parents , the next day of kings will be difficult to please his illusions , since their  |||  home  |||  is made out of no more than 12 people and a goat .
the family lives in a humble house of the colony salvador allende and lives in  |||  poor  |||  conditions because the father does not have a job .
sometimes it is very hard for us because my husband does not have a job , but we sell mandarin and daddy ... in the afternoon i leave with the kids to sell in the street , " said cayetana valenzuela andrade ,  |||  mother  |||  of the children .
adelaida , 4 years old ,  |||  wants  |||  a doll or a bicycle , while her sister isabel , 3 years old , would like a barbie doll .
he told me ( jose alfredo ) , i would like this monster , " but i said " we will see son " because it was very  |||  expensive  |||  , " remembered cayetana with sadness .
for the elder children that were at school clothes and shoes would be  |||  perfect  |||  .
maria guadalupe , 11 years old , is  |||  size  |||  12 ; isaias , 10 years old , is size 10 , whereas miguel , 8 years old , uses size eight .
jose juan , 14 years old , needs tennis , reason why a pair of size five and a  |||  half  |||  or six would helpful to him .
if you want to make this dream come true for the children of the coronado  |||  family  |||  from valenzuela you can participate in the campaign as there is a need for a magician , by donating a toy or cash at the reception of the noroeste .
fourteen persons were arrested and will  |||  face  |||  various charges
the searches  |||  took place  |||  at sherbrooke , oxford and stoke , mostly in the places which served for the production of drugs
" approximately 750 cannabis plants , 4 kilogrammes of hashish , money and equipment which served for production were seized "  |||  stated  |||  klouis - philippe ruel , spokesman of the quebec sûrété .
in all , eleven men and three women were  |||  arrested  |||  , including two presumed heads of this network , two sherbrooke men .
they might  |||  face  |||  accusation of cannabis production , its possession with the object of trafficking plotting , and theft among other things
these searches  |||  took place  |||  following a lengthy inquiry lasting almost a year .
some 70 police officers from the reginal enquiry unit of the estrie of the quebec sûreté , of the  |||  police  |||  department o sherbrooke and nephrémagog police headqurters took part in this police operation .
clandestine migration can be  |||  pursued  |||  without probems
according to the government , the conservatives ' draft law should solve the problem of boatloads of  |||  illegal  |||  migrants , but will in all probability be defeated , since the three opposition parties announced on wednesday that they could not support it .
" i strongly rely on the  |||  charter  |||  . "
the liberals claim that the draft law in its present form which would anable any person from a ship  |||  identified  |||  as carrying clandestine immigrants , would violate the canadian charter of rights and liberties .
" we are opposed and it appears that all the opposition parties are opposed and we will now see what the government does "  |||  declared  |||  m. ducepe
the critic of npd concerning immigration , olivia chow , has  |||  rejected  |||  the out of hand the criticisms statign that her party was not firm enough about illegal immigrants .
" the neo - democrats approve the taking of steps against persons handling  |||  illegal  |||  immigrants and this is what we are doing by means of another draft law , the c - 35 " stated mme chow .
" we do not support the conservatives ' draft law because it attacks refugees and imprisons their children for at least a year , "  |||  explained  |||  mme chow .
the minister of immigration . jason kenney ,  |||  accused  |||  the opposition parties of playing politics and of ignoring the will of canadians .
" canadians are telling deputies loud and clear that they will not tolerate this kind of illegal immigration , these  |||  criminal  |||  operations which target canada and which treat the country like a doormat . "
a conservative has however told the qmi agency that the government would ask for a vote so that  |||  every  |||  opposed deputy shall explain his reasons to his electors .
the new  |||  unity  |||  does not create unanimity
despite the announcement by jean charest of the possible creation of a  |||  permanent  |||  unit for combating corruption and collusion , numerous observers continue to demand the creation of a commission of public inquiry into the subject .
the minister of public security , robrt dutil , asserts that this idea is not new : quebec consulted the new york department of investigation on the  |||  subject  |||  last january .
the metropolis has had a  |||  permanent  |||  anti - corruption unit since 1870 .
it must be said that at a mmeeting of the quebec permanent police council last 29 october this step was never  |||  discussed  |||  , notwithstanding the presence of robert dutil .
minister dutil replied to those fearing that political  |||  power  |||  would have too much influence on the possible future unit .
" you will see the  |||  result  |||  when it is announced , he contented himself with affirming . "
" one is aware of that  |||  problem  |||  . "
" the more obstinately m. charest refuses to  |||  create  |||  this commission of inquiry , the more people will think like you and i that there is something to be hidden , " he explains .
" the only way to get a commission of  |||  inquiry  |||  is for jean charest to resign " explains yves boisvert , professor of ethics and government at the ecole nationale d'administration publique
in order to get out of this impasse he therefore suggests that quebec should give a special mandate to the  |||  general  |||  verifier for the latter to inquire into collusion and corruption .
" one must be able to broaden the  |||  mandate  |||  of the general verifier , " he decides .
he also feels that quebec could confer on the verifier the same powers as those of a commissioner ,  |||  allowing  |||  the former to compel people to testify .
the creation of a  |||  permanent  |||  group of people is not the only project on the charest government programme .
quebec would also ask ottawa to modify the  |||  criminal  |||  code , to make it more suitable for this type of crime .
this request would come from the prosecutor of the marteau operation , who  |||  informed  |||  the minister of justice jean - marc fournier that precedent is not explicit on this type of inquiry .
the federal minister of public security , vic toews confirmed that his colleague at justice , rob nicholson is currently inclined to introduce  |||  certain  |||  amendments .
at the time of the spring 2001 operation , which targeted groups of motor cyclists , even though the  |||  criminal  |||  code had not been adapted , 181 persons were arrested ..
ottawa  |||  subsequently  |||  ruled to adopt the law on gangsterism
|||  rivers  |||  under close surveillance
a  |||  land  |||  slide occurred on wednesday afternoon at shawinigan in mauritia .
two  |||  houses  |||  were evacuated as a precaution .
in the evening another land slide  |||  occurred  |||  at saint - lin - laurentides in lenaudière .
between tuesday and wednesday evening  |||  heavy  |||  rain ( from 40 to 70 millimetres ) fell in several regions .
between 20 and 40 millimetres of  |||  additional  |||  rain were expected between now and thursday evening depending on region .
they received a  |||  total  |||  of up to 100 millimetres of rain .
since these falls will be added to the thawing of snow already lying in  |||  certain  |||  sectors , the overflowing of several rivers is feared .
flood alerts were issued on  |||  wednesday  |||  evening by quebec civil security for the rivers ouareau and achigan in lenaudière .
in the lanaudière region , heavy rains  |||  caused  |||  the overflowing of certain lakes at sainte - julienne , sainte - marcelline - de - kildare , as well as at rawdon .
in the outaouais , the overflowing of  |||  certain  |||  lakes entailed the closure of several roads , in particular in the municipality of mansfield - et - pontefract .
annik bouchard , a security consultant , stated that civil security continued to be in a  |||  state  |||  of alert and was monitoring the situation closely .
on wednesday , quebec flood forecast centre  |||  issued  |||  flood warnings in respect of several rivers , in particular maskinongé , assomption , ouareau , l'achigan , batiscan and loup .
dupont  |||  partly  |||  blamed
tne cnnr feels that m. dupont and his team of choi 98,1 fm had the  |||  right  |||  to express their views , but that certain topics contained " inexact information on social assistance , unduly negative statements concerning haitians and coarse language not suitable for daytime broadcasts . "
the council also concluded that a discussion about  |||  suicide  |||  including the broadcasting of the names of two persons who had committed suicide , did not infringe broadcasting codes .
the ccnr had received several complaints on the subject of  |||  comments  |||  made during bradcasts between 2008 and 2010 .
the first decision was given following a complaint by the quebec common  |||  front  |||  of persons receiving social assistance .
the animators must  |||  present  |||  solid , not deceptive information .
concerning suicide , the animator stephane dupont  |||  felt  |||  that suicide was the action of a coward .
the majority of members of the committee concluded that the message conveyed was that suicide should not be  |||  seen  |||  as a solution of life 's problems .
" the majority of the committee feels that the episodes in question of " dupont midday " approached a delicate subject in a balanced and  |||  appropriate  |||  manner . "
the last dispute  |||  concerned  |||  the declarations which followed the haiti earthquake .
stéphane dupont and jean - rené dufort then had a face - to - face  |||  media  |||  discussion , which gave rise to a lot of reactions .
the choi animator declared that he had not made any contribution to help the haitians , because one could not be certain that the people in need really would  |||  receive  |||  the money .
the committee believes that the comments were not improper , but that their cumulative  |||  effect  |||  concerning haitians was unduly negative .
in all its  |||  decisions  |||  the committee condemns the broadcasting of coarse language .
the broadcaster choi - fn collaborated " beyond the call of  |||  duty  |||  " in all cases .
the king of kung - fu in  |||  montreal  |||
the athlete , who excels at " sanda " ( "  |||  full  |||  contact " kung - fu ) , at kickboxing and at thai boxing , is entering the tatami and the rings of the world in search of fresh challanges .
recently , the man  |||  working  |||  as security agent for the ups company , had bad news for his rivals , having gained two gold medals in the amateur world championship of the world karate and kickboxing association ( wka ) held from 23 to 30 october in edinburgh in scotland .
" i won in the classes of  |||  full  |||  contact kickboxing and thai boxing , " he explained .
" i am  |||  currently  |||  preparing to go to china for the san shou world cup . "
" competitors who finished among the first four zt the preceding world championship in each class , were  |||  invited  |||  . "
" in vietnam in 2005 , i  |||  finished  |||  eigth . "
" i  |||  finished  |||  fifth in the 2007 tournament in china and third in toronto in 2009 , " he added .
" what is interesting is that i did better at  |||  each  |||  competition . "
the " san shou " or " sanda " is an original  |||  chinese  |||  contest , where punches and kicks , as well as throwing to the ground is authorised .
the most famous pugilist from this form of combat is the american of vietnamese origin , cung le , well  |||  known  |||  in the world of martial arts .
" this  |||  competition  |||  is the most often mentioned and the most prestigious in china , " explained the agreeable , strapping young man .
" it is the  |||  equivalent  |||  of the lumpinee stadium , ( the largest stadium in thailand ) . "
" it was a super  |||  experience  |||  . "
zemmal won his first fight , a semi -  |||  final  |||  in his class ( 80 kg ) , before losing in the finals .
" the man who beat me was a  |||  real  |||  professional " he analysed .
" the winners in  |||  each  |||  class fight one another for the title of a sigle champion , the king of kung - fu . "
hydro - quebec awarded 450 million dollars ' worth of contracts to engineering  |||  companies  |||  for the eastmain - 1 - a - sarcelle - rupert hydroelectric project .
at the core of this avalanche of over 100 contracts is a consortium formed by the companies bpr . dessau , sn group and axor , which secured the most important one , that of  |||  managing  |||  the project for the sum of 295 million dollars without a call for tender .
the consortium called energie gérance was formed in 2004 , leaving it to hydro - quebec at its option to pass its responsibility for managing this important hydroelectric project  |||  worth  |||  5000 million dollars to the private sector .
at the beginning of 2005 the energie gérance consortium secured this lucrative  |||  contract  |||  without a prior public call for tender .
as far as the quebec party is concerned , recourse to company consortia poses a serious problem , that of elimination of competition and of an  |||  increase  |||  of price .
" this is the new way of colluding and defeating  |||  competition  |||  . "
" this means that rather than behaving secretively , people now behave openly , "  |||  declared  |||  the quebec party deputy silvain simard at a press conference .
what is usually involved is an alliance limited over time , which allows two or more companies to combine their respective expertises in order to respond to a  |||  call  |||  for tender for a complex project .
the eastmain project comprises a  |||  high  |||  level of complexity , taking into account the extent of the works .
the site is in progress and must extend  |||  until  |||  2012 .
likewise , the formula of consortia is no longer an exception in quebec , even in respect of relatively  |||  simple  |||  projects .
as was disclosed last week by le devoir , the formula of consortia in the engineering consultancy sector is the subject of a  |||  government  |||  inquiry .
so , for example , the desseau company  |||  works  |||  in partnership with the majority of its principal competitors , including cima + , génivar , snc - lavalin and others such as roche and tecsult .
|||  every  |||  combination and there are tens of them , comes back to one and the same company , namely desseau .
" if you launch a call for tender and if there are few tenderers , your prices will be too  |||  high  |||  . "
this contract awarded to the energie gérance consortium , forms part of a  |||  long  |||  list of contracts of over 50 000 $ secured by the quebec psrty .
the contracts were awarded by hydro - quebec or sebj for the eastmain - 1 - a - sarcelle - rupert  |||  project  |||  .
snc - lavalin grabbed 22  |||  contracts  |||  , génivar 16 , tecsult 14 and dessau 10 , not counting its participation in eergie gérance .
sylvain simard let it be known that the four companies comprsing the consortium ( bpr , dessau , group sn and axor ) are " well  |||  known  |||  to quebec liberal party . "
minister normandeau let slip that the quebec party is also  |||  linked  |||  to these companies who " finance " it , before stating that it was rather its directors , who were involved .
barometer of the responsible consumption - the "  |||  green  |||  " label does not inspire confidence .
the quebec consumer has little confidence in durable development players , but also in equitable brands and in certificates claimed to be ecological , to guide his  |||  choice  |||  .
worse , if he immerses himself in the universe of the media where messages in favour of more responsibe consumption pullulate , he deplores the lack of reliable information , a piece of neglect which he even describes as a brake on his commitment , indicates the barometer of  |||  responsible  |||  consumption whose first reading took place today .
even if they brought about an increase of consumption of so - called socially  |||  responsible  |||  products in 2010 , quebec inhabitants appear to have little faith in those who are trying to sell it to them .
two - thirds among them say in effect that they do not believe in the environmental commitment of companies , or their green publicity disclosing the tool of measurement drawn up by the  |||  responsible  |||  consumption observatory of sherbrooke university .
another finding : half of consumers entertain doubts concerning the reliability of official certifications appearing on so - called equitable products , but also concerning the credibility of products and brands marked as eco -  |||  responsible  |||  , indicates the barometer .
in the same vein , the talk of  |||  politicians  |||  on this topic is taken seriously by only 14.6 % of quebec inhabitants .
nevertheless , information concerning  |||  responsible  |||  consumption appears to be fundamental for the stimulation of this kind of current consumption by two - thirds of quebec inhabitants .
in fact , the vacuum and the doubtful nature of the  |||  information  |||  would cool the ardour of 46 % of consumers .
it is the second most important brake after the higher price of these products  |||  identified  |||  by the barometer .
moreover , two - thirds of quebec inhabitants say that they mistrust the alleged performamce of "  |||  green  |||  " products or services which are being placed in their hands .
up to 61 % of them thus favoured  |||  buying  |||  from their local shops and preferred foodstuffs grown in their region , indicate the barometer .
but its social and ecological conscience nevertheless appears to be restricted to the outside of its vehicle , indicates the barometer : in 2010 , scarcely 28 % of quebec inhabitants  |||  stated  |||  that they used public transport or recommended its use in order to defend their green interests .
walking and cycling were also  |||  supported  |||  by 19.1 % of participants in this huge bahavioural inquiry .
the quebec government which was asked to become financial involved in the purchase of the excentris cinema  |||  complex  |||  by the angus and parallel company , agrees to collaborate , but only in the form of a loan .
the angus and parallel development company which hoped for a grant of seven million dollars from the ministry of culture to purchase from daniel langlois the cinema  |||  complex  |||  excentris on boulevard saint - laurent , restoring to it its full cinemaphile vocation , will not secure what they are asking for .
rather than the expected donation , the quebe government is offering a loan which will be less than initially expected and which could be a  |||  viable  |||  solution on advantageous conditions , at least according to state sources .
a proposal amd an action plan were  |||  sent  |||  to minister st - pierre by the chairman of the société dedéveloppement des entreprises culturelles ( sodec ) françois nacerola , who is piloting the excenrtic file .
he sent him a  |||  final  |||  report ten days ago .
it nevertheless  |||  appears  |||  that the assumption of a donation must really be abandoned .
but several local players , on the other hand , claimed substantial  |||  economic  |||  help .
daniel langlois , the previosu owner , supported the author 's cinema on the  |||  complex  |||  premises after having himself financed its construction , which was able to justify a waiver by the treasury .
there is a crying  |||  lack  |||  of halls for showing independent films in montreal and excentris knew how to gain the loyalty of its customers .
but cristian yaccarini has not called back le devoir and it is not known what he and his group think about the proposals for a  |||  reduction  |||  , which have been made to them .
the veil lifted on a complex  |||  canada  |||  ....
the new american diplomatic cables divulged by wikileaks have lifted the veil on what the united states  |||  consider  |||  to be an inferiority complex of canadians towards americans , but they also betray a superiority complex of the later towards canada .
thus , american diplomats are astonished that every canadian elector does not have canado - american relations at heart when voting and believe that the visit by president obama helped the conservative government to have its 2009 budget  |||  adopted  |||  !
a cable dated 22 setember 2008 , in the very middle of the federal election campaign , tells to what extent the united states form part of the stakes being debated by political  |||  leaders  |||  .
to the great astonishment of the  |||  american  |||  ambassador in ottawa , david wilkins .
mr. wilkins  |||  offers  |||  some explanations of this situation .
" an almost inherent canadian inferiority complex is perhaps inducing canadian political leaders to speak about everyday internal stakes , rather than blame this election on the united states ( as during the  |||  free  |||  exchange campaign of 1988 ) .
the united states therefore are , he concludes , " the proverbial elephant of this  |||  election  |||  : omnipresent , but potentially too threatening to be talked about . "
the ambassador understands this " deafening silence " all the less , since the two countries have an intense political and  |||  economic  |||  relationship .
" logically , " he feels , " the ability of a candidate , of a party and even more of a party leader to mamage this  |||  essential  |||  relationship must be a key factor , which the voters have in mind when voting . "
the other expression of this important sentiment is found in the cable  |||  sent  |||  on 22 january 2009 by terry breese , chargé d'affaires in ottawa , preparing president barack obama for his first visit to ottawa .
" your journey will help ensure the government 's survival of the vote of confidence at the  |||  start  |||  of february on the federal budget , which will post canada 's first deficit for over ten years due to a relaunch plan of 30 to 40 thousand million dollars , " writes mr. breese .
nowhere can be found any mention that the government had to adjourn parliament before christmas to avoid being defeated by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional on the quality of the  |||  proposed  |||  relaunch plan .
|||  another  |||  communication dated janaury 2008 and signed by ambassador wilkins , warns washington about the increasingly negative image of the united states conveyed by drama series broadcasts by cbc .
the ambassador is worried by broadcasts such as border ,  |||  little  |||  mosque on the prairie , intelligece and h 2o , which contain unsubtle references to maher arar , to the " no fly list " or again to kidnappings for rigorous interrogation by the cia .
another cable tells that during their first bilateral meeting , hillary clinton asked her french opposite number bernard kouchner , whether europe was ready to  |||  receive  |||  certain guantanamo prisoners .
m. kouchner replied " yes , " but on a  |||  case  |||  - by - case basis .
at the end of the  |||  meeting  |||  , he wrote , " he handed a paper to the secretary of state on the subject of omar khadr , a moslem aged 15 of canadian origin . "
tom flanagan , an former adviser very  |||  close  |||  to stephen harper , declared on cbc waves that the person responsible for this massive leak should be " asassinated . "
he echoed mike huckabee in the  |||  united  |||  states .
a worldwide  |||  plan  |||  for renewing lighting .
illumination is  |||  responsible  |||  for 8 % of worldwide emissions .
but it will be necessary to subtract from this figure a further 5 gt to stabilise the increase of climate warming by 2020 at 2°c in order to avoid loss of  |||  control  |||  .
and they contain no  |||  mercury  |||  .
but , states the report , the principal source of mercury emission on the planet is not the fluocompast bulb , but rather carbon thermal emission centres , which emit a lot of mercury to  |||  produce  |||  the electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs .
in the united states  |||  alone  |||  , these centres emit 25 000 tonnes of mercury a year .
the report details the gains , which  |||  every  |||  country would achieve through this international programme .
for example , indonesia would  |||  save  |||  a thousand million dollars a year on purchases of electricity and eight million tonnes of co 2 , the equivalent of 3.5 thermal centres , whose construction would cost 2.5 thousand million dollars .
ivory coast is nervously  |||  expecting  |||  the announcement of the election results .
the uno secretary -  |||  general  |||  , ban ki - moon , has called for the publication " without delay " of the results of the ivory coast presidential election , on the expiry of the set period .
" the secretary -  |||  general  |||  stresses the need for the independent electoral commission to complete its work and to announce the provisional results without further delay " stressed a spokesman for the head of uno . "
despite pressures exerted by certain foreign governments , the electoral commission has  |||  allowed  |||  th target date of wednesday midnight to pass , without publishing the results three days after the sunday voting .
about forty minutes before the expiry of the set period the president of the independent electoral commission "  |||  continued  |||  to work " on the announbcement of the results .
throughout the world ,  |||  calls  |||  became more frequent on wednesday for the electoral commission finally to declare the name of the winner of the second round , laurent gbagbo or his opponenent alassane ouattara .
but the gbagbo camp is counting ont he cancellation by the constitutional council of " fraudulent " votes in the north , received by the ex - rebels of the new forces ( fn ) since the  |||  failed  |||  coup d'état in september 2002 .
pascal affi n'buessan , campaign director of the ivory coast president , stated that the manoeeuvres of intimidation of electors by the fn in the north of the country had dissuaded the partisans of the leaving president from  |||  voting  |||  .
gbagbo 's enemies allege that the highest court of the coutry is not impartial , since it is presided by paul yao n'dré , a  |||  close  |||  political ally of gbagbo .
alassane ouattara , the man from the north , who denies any links with the ex - rebels , has described as " unacceptable " the delay in making the announcement of the results and has asked gbagbo to  |||  respect  |||  them , but has not gone so far as to claim victory .
on wednesday uno warned the ivory coast political class that it  |||  might  |||  be held respoonsible for any violence .
laurent gbagbo finished at the top in the first round on 11 october , with 38 % of votes against 32 % for alassane ouattara , who  |||  received  |||  the public support of the former presdient henri konan bedié ( 25 % in the firts round ) .
the rate of unemployment in france has  |||  remained  |||  stable in the 3rd quarter .
the rate of unemployment in france according to the international labour office has remained stable at 9.3 % in metropolitan france ( 9.7 % taking into account overseas départements ) trnspires from data corrected for provisional seasonal variations ( cvs )  |||  published  |||  on thursday by the insee .
the number of  |||  unemployed  |||  is 2.631 million in metropolitan france .
the data for the second quarter were confirmed at 9.3 % of native working  |||  population  |||  and 9.7 of the dom .
over one year , unemployment has risen by 0.1  |||  points  |||  .
in the third quarter , 637 000  |||  young  |||  people between 15 and 24 were unemployed ( bit ) .
older people experienced a slight rise of unemployment to 6.4 % in metropolitan france ( + 0.2 points over three months and over a year ) ,  |||  equal  |||  to 482 000 persons of 50 or over and 6.6 % for the dom .
only the 25-39 benefited from stable unemployment in the third quarter being 8. , 3 % in metropolitan france ( -0.1 points over three months and + 0.1 pointsover a year ) and 8.8 % in the  |||  whole  |||  of france .
since 2006 , the insee no longer publishes the monnhly unemployment  |||  rate  |||  , following arguments about its method of calculation .
on the other hand , eurostat , the statistical agency of the euroean union , continues to do so and on tuesday announced a rate of 9.8 % for france ( dom  |||  included  |||  ) in october after 9.9 % in september .
alexandre guerini , 53 , director of waste processing companies and brother of the president of general council of bouches - du - rhone , was arrested and sent to luynes prison  |||  near  |||  aix - en - provence in the context of an investigation of public contracts presumed fraudulent .
according to his attorney , alexandre guerini is  |||  accused  |||  of the abusive use of company property , the theft public funds , of receiving stolen goods , of active corruption and of the sale of influence .
" it is easy to accuse him of a  |||  number  |||  of reprehensible actions , but quite another to prove them " declared his attorney , florence rault , to apf , before her client 's hearing .
m. guerini , brother of the strong man of the socialist party in the département , jean - noel guerini , passed to his  |||  judge  |||  prior to his hearing through his attorney an explanatory memorandum .
according to his attorney , me lucien simon , his client never did  |||  anything  |||  other than perform his duties .
|||  concerning  |||  the award of contracts or the destination of the related funds , he had no knowledge of them , said me simon .
" my  |||  client  |||  has given explanations of the allegations against him . "
|||  four  |||  other persons were detained for questioning and released during the night of tuesday to wednmesday , two of them on bail , said the assistant public prosecutor , michel raffin .
michel karabadjakian , assistant director -  |||  general  |||  of the cleansingof marseille province metropole ( mpm ) is being prosecuted for " sale of influence and passive corruption . "
two functionaries of the aubagne conurbation . michèle duval and christophe bringuier , were arrested and quationed one concerning the " theft of public  |||  property  |||  by a person responsible for public service " and the other concerning " complicity in the theft of public funds . "
among persons confronted with m. guerini is stephane brunengo - girard , recetly arrested in a parallel affair  |||  concerning  |||  fraudulent public contracts involving corsica .
the investigation is being conducted in the context of several court investigations of x in april 2009 following anonymous letters  |||  concerning  |||  presumed fraud relating to public contracts , in particular for waste disposal .
according to a source  |||  close  |||  to the inquiry , the investigations concentrate in particular on the conditions of the award and functioning of a discharge of la ciotat , which collects aubagne waste as well as the waste from certain towns of the urban community of marseille ( mpm ) .
affair of clothilde reiss : the elysée has exaggerated the involvement of  |||  syria  |||
all under the careful scrutiny of  |||  united  |||  states diplomats .
they show how the french authorities have tried to convince washington that the release of the young frenchwoman was not balanced by the release of majid kakavand , an iranian under arrest in france and sought by american justice for trafficking in materials for the  |||  benefit  |||  of the iranian nuclear programme .
in reality , he had not done  |||  anything  |||  .
a diplomatic cable sent on 12 august 2009 to paris is entitled " iran : french comments on how to  |||  manage  |||  cases of hostages . "
the elysée adviser on strategic matters , françois richier , accompanied by the director of quai d'orsay for north africa and the middle east , patrice paoli , had a discussion with the  |||  american  |||  diplomat , kathleen alegrone .
they explained to her the french  |||  method  |||  .
they advised the americans to arrange to repatriate their own  |||  nationals  |||  detained in iran .
" make a lot of noise , " they said , " hammer ceaselessly the words " fundamental rights of man , " " innocence " and " immediate release " in the  |||  media  |||  . "
" you must not embarrass the  |||  iranian  |||  regime , which is sensitive to its image . "
he announced that therelease of clotilde reiss from prison ( which will take place on 16 august , the day on which she took refuge in the  |||  french  |||  embassy ) would involve paying the iranians a large sum of money ( 230 000 eur as a caution ) .
and he advised that the elysée expected other hostage crises , a  |||  phenomenon  |||  which would get worse .
he said that the iranians  |||  might  |||  arrest in the near future another of some 1800 french citizens who live in iran .
a piece of information was broadcast : the iranian majid kakavand , whose extradition for illegal traffic in sensitive electronic material to iran the  |||  united  |||  states are demanding , was freed in paris by a court .
according to  |||  numerous  |||  observers , the american embassy is considering this worrying coincidence .
for washington which tracks iranian  |||  illegal  |||  nuclear material acquisition networks , the release of majid khakavgand is bad news .
during the  |||  conversation  |||  with kathleen allegrone on 4 september , françois richier gave an assurance that this was not the case .
he said that there were lively exchanges betwen the french presidency and and the garde des sceaux at the time , michèle alliot - marie . but the  |||  french  |||  government could not change the court ruling .
m. richier also wants to  |||  demonstrate  |||  that majid kakavand continues under close surveilance by the french secret service .
the elysée adviser dials a number , hangs up and then informs the american diplomat that the iranian is currently in a paris building  |||  managed  |||  by the iranian embassy .
during clotilde reiss ' detention in iran , the elysée did not control its efforts by means of communiques and  |||  media  |||  " leaks " to create the impression that the syrian pesident bachar al-assad was playing the important and influential part of an intermediary .
the americans observe this activity without irony and find that manipulation bears fruit because several press articles repeat the official  |||  french  |||  version .
a telegram dated 25 august 2009 mentions the  |||  media  |||  " blitz " by french officials .
on what is  |||  based  |||  so much " gratitude " epressed to m. assad , asks the paris embassy .
notwithstanding their declarations full of praise ,  |||  french  |||  officials privately admit that they only have the vaguest notion of what the syrians really did .
the  |||  document  |||  then deals with the reasons why the elysée put out this fiction .
it states that the intensive effort of  |||  communication  |||  tries to validate sarkozy 's policy of moving closer to syria .
on 11 august , françois richier confided him that the french did not of course know  |||  whether  |||  the syrians had done anything .. " bien sûr , nous ne savons pas si les syriens ont fait quoi que ce soit . "
but that they still  |||  thanked  |||  them .
nicolas sarkozy  |||  receives  |||  her at the elysée .
in a communique , he thanks the presidents fo brazil , senegal and syria for their " active role in favour of the  |||  release  |||  of our compatriot . "
no on -  |||  line  |||  games for young koreans after midnight .
according to government authorities , the south korean governemt will pass a law called " cinderella , " which will prohibit adolescents from playing on -  |||  line  |||  games after midnight by means of bocking their access .
according to representaitves of the ministries of culture and family , a draft law will be submitted to parliament in december to ask on - line game companies to  |||  block  |||  access of juvenies under 16 to their games after midnight .
a lot of children play these games all night and then experience  |||  difficulties  |||  in studying at school and in living a normal life in daytime .
" we think that this law is  |||  needed  |||  to ensure their health and their right to sleep , " declared to afp jo rin , the minister in charge of piloting the draft law .
on -  |||  line  |||  games will now be accessible at 6 a.m.
the minister stated that the companies would have one year to  |||  prepare  |||  themselves for the application of the law .
he added that the government would also ask the companies to  |||  limit  |||  the daily time of access to these games by young people whose parents have asked for this to be done .
he would also make available to people requesting it , free - of - charge software making it possible to limit time  |||  spent  |||  on internet .
south korea is one of the most " connected " countries and the newspapers regularly report various facts  |||  linked  |||  to an intensive use of the internet .
the country is also the undisputed champion of  |||  worldwide  |||  online game competitions .
in november , south korea won four gold medals at  |||  world  |||  cyber games in a contest of 58 other nations .
|||  world  |||  championships 2018-2022 : fifa appoints organising countries .
torment due to suspected corruption . on thursday , the executive committee of fifa will appoint countries to organise world cup matches in 2018 and 2022 , an eminently politcal  |||  choice  |||  , where influence and lobbying battles are liable to take precedence of technical criteria .
one thing is  |||  certain  |||  ; the 2018 edition of the fifa competition will take place in europe , the traditional bastion of the game ( 4 candidates , great britain , russia , spain - portugal and belgium - the netherlands ; angleterre , russie , espagne - portugal , pays - bas - belgique ) .
that of 2022 will be a lot more exotic , fifa hoping to conquer new territories ( quatar , australia ) after a first contest on the african continent in 2010 or to  |||  pursue  |||  its introduction into the usa , or the far east ( japan , south korea ) .
behind - the - scenes bargaining may therefore  |||  last  |||  up to the last minute .
for the rest , it is difficult to  |||  establish  |||  a hierarchy among the candidates .
according to a fifa assessment report , the british , spanish - portuguese ( 2018 ) and  |||  american  |||  ( 2022 ) cases advance better arguments than their competitors .
but these considerations will not weigh very heavily with the 22 members of the  |||  executive  |||  committee , when it comes to voting .
the sunday times whiose disclosures resulted in the suspension of two members of the executive committee ( reynald temerii and amos adamu ) ,  |||  might  |||  thus have ruined the chances of its country , the cradle of football , which only hosted the world cup once , in 1966 .
on monday the bbc broadcast a documentary concerning three influential  |||  members  |||  of the executive committee , ricardo teizeira , nicolas leoz and issa hayatou .
the head of the british  |||  government  |||  hopes to repeat the coup of his predessesor tony blair , who in 2005 secured the choice of london as the venue of the 2012 olympic games .
will this intensive  |||  activity  |||  suffice to reguild the shield of england in the eyes of the executive committee ?
nothing is less  |||  certain  |||  , because the spain - portugal duo does not lack for advantages , with its stadia already completed , its expertise ( world cup 82 in spain , 1992 olympic games in barcelona , euro 2004 in portugal ) and its football culture .
but the sombre  |||  economic  |||  and financial prospects of the two countries could pour cold water on their ambitions .
but the  |||  prime minister  |||  vladimir putin decided not to travel to zurich and denounced " unfair competition in the preparation of voting " in a veiled reference to accusations in the british press against members of the executive committee .
concerning 2022 , the united states with expereince of 1994 ,  |||  appear  |||  the obvious favourites .
the leading world ecomomic power , the seat of the principal sponsors of fifa , the country  |||  appears  |||  to have a big lead over japan and south korea who have separately built a very fine project .
|||  another  |||  threat : the award of the 2026 world competition to china , ardently desired by fifa , which will in fact extinguish asian chances for 2022 .
like japan and south korea , australia could also suffer from the weakness of tv rights of  |||  european  |||  countries , the nerve centre of the war for fifa .
|||  second  |||  mandate : the evidence
de gaulle  |||  really  |||  hesitated .
valery giscard d'estaing and  |||  jacques  |||  chirac had not the slightest hesitation .
and  |||  nicolas  |||  sakozy still fewer than they .
accordingly , the  |||  current  |||  head of state will be a candidate in 2012 .
but the evidence conflicts with the mystique of the presidential  |||  function  |||  .
it is now  |||  necessary  |||  to pretend that the doubt had always existed .
in one  |||  sense  |||  as in the other .
in 2006 , even without believing it , friends of jacques chirac pretended that a third mandate was not  |||  excluded  |||  .
the fact that on tuesday night at the elysée  |||  before  |||  ump deputies he called up the prospect of " two mandates " sowed some feverish reflections .
the president only recalled that the 2008 revised constiution  |||  limited  |||  the number of five - year terms to only two .
this is not for the first time that he humorously mentions the presidential  |||  election  |||  at such meetings .
he said in july 2009 that at  |||  best  |||  they only had another seven and a half years of him .
his intentions of the day before yesterday did not make him any more or any less a  |||  candidate  |||  than those of the day before that .
on the one hand , the acceleration of the progress of the candidature of the socialist  |||  party  |||  .
for the first time , voters on the  |||  right  |||  preferred the candidature of françois fillon to that of nicolas sarkozy ( 45 % against 44 % , according to eva - l'express ) .
the entourage of the prime minister immediately said that it had a  |||  candidate  |||  and that there was no debate about this within ump .
alain juppé said in the face of evidence and by way of correction that the candidate would always  |||  believe  |||  that he could win .
euro : bce compelled to buy  |||  state  |||  securities
the last annual meeting of the  |||  board  |||  of governors of the european central bank ( bce ) had to be the occasion of specifying the methods of emerging from the crisis , or at least of announcing the end of a good number of unconventional monetary policy operations , which have to be completed by the year end .
the european  |||  sovereign  |||  debt crisis obliges the issuing institute in frankfurt to bahave less peremptorily , on pain of aggravating the situation , which is now more than tense enough already on european markets of obligation .
the political  |||  cost  |||  would be all the higher .
yesterday at a press conference , the  |||  french  |||  minister of finance , christine lagarde greeted the active role played by the bce to resolve the debt crisis of european states .
she did not wish to say whether she thought that the central bank had to do more , for example , by  |||  increasing  |||  its programme of buying sovereign bonds .
she said that she would communicate her thoughts to her  |||  european  |||  partners .
in brussels on the day before during his hearing before the economic and monetary affairs commission of the european parliament , the chairman of the bce , jean - claude trichet did not prove more diffuse about his intentions , contenting himself with saying that the programme of buying state securities in the secondary market would continue and that they would see what will be decided at the  |||  meeting  |||  on thursday .
factually , the obligatory treasury purchases by the bce doubled during  |||  last  |||  week to almost 1.35 thousand million euros .
and , according to indiscretions of market operators , it made fresh purchases of  |||  irish  |||  and portuguese bonds yesterday .
there is no  |||  doubt  |||  among market operators about the expectations of a pursuit of purchases ( see page 29 ) .
whilst loan operations at over three months have already disappeared from the bce bank arsenal , the latter continues to grant unlimited cash loans on generous  |||  terms  |||  and for periods from one weke to three months .
economists now expect that the facility will be  |||  extended  |||  by some months .
michael schubert , an economist at commerzbank cannot  |||  imagine  |||  that it will modify it programe to any great extent .
norbest bräms , an economist at sal says that a gradual exit to be announced during the firts quarter of 2011  |||  appears  |||  more likely .
norbet bräms adds that on the level of its interventions in the  |||  public  |||  debt market , the bce would have to make purchases of these bonds adequately large to revive the lacklustre market .
taking into account the large exposure of european banks to  |||  sovereign  |||  debt markets of the euro zone , the issuing institute has no option other than to maintain a presence in the market .
an important bonds manager said yesterday that the bank must at all costs offsat the shortage of investors in the market and  |||  prevent  |||  a boom of payments by the most vulnerable states .
in italy , the berlusconi  |||  government  |||  is turning its back .
|||  return  |||  to precarious calm .
on leaving a  |||  meeting  |||  with the minister of the economy , the regional presidents said that giulio tremonti described the situation as " insoluble " and that he was waiting for an unforeseeable weekend , which he subsequently denied .
in any event on tuesday the difference between german long - term rates reached a  |||  record  |||  of 210 base points and the price of contracts to cover the risk of bankruptcy ( cds ) took off to reach 263 points , producing a certain amount of panic in rome .
at a session of the council of ministers , silvio berlusconi pointed out that in spain the differential from  |||  german  |||  rates was over 400 base points .
but his right arm , gianni letta ,  |||  declared  |||  himself very worried by market turbulence and by a possible contagion from ireland .
the good  |||  news  |||  is that italy , the third largest economy of the eurozone , is not like greece and ireland .
according to irwin stezer , an econoist at the hudson institute , the bad  |||  news  |||  is that it is like portugal .
clearly , its problem is an absence of growth and inadequate tax revenues , placing the  |||  state  |||  in in danger of no longer being able to cover its financial requirements .
the most recent forecasts from brussels acted like a cold shower on the  |||  government  |||  .
|||  italian  |||  growth is now expected to be 1.1 % in 2011 and 1.4 % in 2012 , whist the budget now under scrutiny by the senate records 1.3 and 2.0 % respectively .
under these conditions , the european commission calculates that the public deficit will be 4.3 % of the gdp  |||  next  |||  year ( versus 3.9 % forecast by the government ) and 3.5 % in 2012 ( instead of the forecast of 2.7 % ) .
this is the reason for the rumour of a new collective budget of 7 thousand million euros , which  |||  might  |||  be drawn up after the holidays .
the economic affairs commissioner olli rehn said that if  |||  necessary  |||  , new austerity measures will have to be taken .
for the  |||  moment  |||  , italy receives support from international institutions .
arrigo sadun , the italian administrator of the international monetary fund in charge of italy at the imf assures that the foundations of  |||  italian  |||  economy are sound .
pier carlo padoan , chief economist of ocde , states that there is no problem in the immediate future , in the  |||  short  |||  or in the long term , because despite its large debt ( 119.2 % of gip in 2011 , ndlr ) . stabilisation efforts demanded from italy are smaller than those demanded from other countries .
there remains the question of political  |||  instability  |||  .
a period not suited to the taking of decisions in the event of a  |||  serious  |||  crisis would then begin .
christine lagarde hammered the following home yesterday at a press conference in paris : she said that she believed europeans showed on sunday both day and night that they are committed to  |||  defend  |||  their currency and their monetary zone .
although that it was only relative , the detente recorded here yesterday of interest rates on european state bonds  |||  brought  |||  water to the mills of governments and of the bce .
but one cannot yet speak about a start of  |||  normalisation  |||  .
the standard &  |||  poor  |||  agency announced that it might devalue the portuguese debt , the target of most of today 's speculation .
the economists of exane bnp paribas feel that as in may , there is a  |||  real  |||  lack of clarity and political transparency encumbering banking systems in particular .
all the more because  |||  political  |||  time moves much more slowly than market time .
aware of this gap and of the dangers which it conceals , european countries are intensifying their  |||  discussions  |||  aimed at strengthening their existing anti - crisis devices .
informal consultations between ministers of  |||  finance  |||  of countries most directly concerned and more widely their g 20 opposite numbers , are well advanced .
and also in the expectation of meetings of the eurogroup and the ecofin at the start of  |||  next  |||  week .

yesterday , an official american representative told reuter that the united states would support a possible  |||  increase  |||  of funds for direct supplementary involvement of the imf .
front line coutries such as spain and portugal are preparing to adopt structural reforms , particularly  |||  concerning  |||  organisation of the labour market .

in paris on 24 november , axel weber first put forward the  |||  idea  |||  that if the 750 thousand million euros released by europe and the imf were not adequate , the unnion would not hesitate to resort to the portfolio .
economists at barclay capital , a top eureopean  |||  sovereign  |||  debt market player , feel that an increase of about 100 thousand million euros , preferably in the form of a direct cash injection , would suffice .

episodes of snow are still causing traffic problems , especially in the secondary network in brittany and may disrupt certain  |||  economic  |||  activities .
twenty - four départements are on orange alert due to a  |||  risk  |||  of snow and ice .
eure , eure - et - loir , deux - sèvres ad vienne have  |||  joined  |||  the 20 départements already on orange alert , 18 since wednesday afternoon and two , dordogne and gironde , later during the night .
the départements in question are charente , charente - maritime , cotes d'armor , finistere , gironde , dordogne , poitou and those of the  |||  regions  |||  of basse - normandie , ile - de - france and limousin .
according to meteo france , snow episodes are sufficiently marked to create traffic problems and to disrupt  |||  certain  |||  economic activities .
traffic on the brittany secondary network is very  |||  difficult  |||  and the gendarmerie recommends that vehicles should only be used where absolutely necessary . traffic of certain ter vehices has been suspended for the day .

metro grand  |||  paris  |||  : first financial proposals ;
since the time when the  |||  debate  |||  about the modernisation of transport in the ile - de - france reached its highest point , thousands of millions of euros have been haemorrhaging .
in the  |||  discussion  |||  of means .
mention is made in  |||  particular  |||  of the 23 thousand million euros for the grand paris metro which the grand paris company is to build .
in the theoretical scheme , it is this sum which will then enable the sgp to borrow in the market a part of the financing of its  |||  double  |||  loop .
there are two of them : the creation of a special equipment tax and an increase of the tax on  |||  offices  |||  in the ile - de - france .
the second is a recasting of a tax on officesm which exists already " in order to modernise , to  |||  increase  |||  its yield and to allocate this increase to the grand paris company . "
it falls far short of the 4 thousand  |||  million  |||  .
sgp does not find this  |||  system  |||  shocking .
it is explained that from the moment the two sources of cash were  |||  created  |||  ( the two taxes , ndlr ) it would be possible to cover the cost of three years of study and then resort to the 4 thousand million euros .
" this would be included in the  |||  budget  |||  and drawn on as the project develops "
this device , in which the  |||  promised  |||  4 thousand million euros are already included , may give rise to a somewhat excited parliamentary debate .
first  |||  public  |||  session on 7 december .
the wikileaks affair has a  |||  double  |||  significance .
on the one hand , it is a scandal , which only looked scandalous in the light of the hypocrisy which prevails in relations between states , citizens and the  |||  press  |||  .
on the other hand , it announces profound changes on international level and points to a  |||  future  |||  dominated by regression .
the first aspect of wikileaks is a confirmation of the fact that  |||  every  |||  secret service case ( of any country ) consists solely of press cuttings .
the " extraordinary " american revelations about the sexual habits of berlusconi only report what it was possible to  |||  read  |||  for months in any daily ( except in those belonging to berlusconi ) and the sinister caricature profile of khadafi has long been a cabaret artists'sketch material .
the rule according to which secret files may only contain already known news is  |||  essential  |||  for secret services dynamic and not only in the present century .
if you visit a library devoted to american publications , you will see that every work repeats ( concerning the grail , the mystery of rennes - le - chateau , the templars , or the rosicrucians ) exactly that which was already set out in  |||  earlier  |||  works .
and this is so not only because the author of occult texts does not like to do previously unpublished research ( and does not know where to look for news about what does not exist ) , but because those who devote themsslves to occultism , do not  |||  believe  |||  what they already know and which confirms what they had already learned .
this is dan brown 's  |||  success  |||  mechanism .
the same applies to  |||  secret  |||  files .
on the one hand , they say that every cultivated person already knows that embassies have , at least since the end of the second world war and since heads of state could telephone one another or fly to meet for dinner ,  |||  lost  |||  their diplomatic function and except for some little representation exercises , have become centres of espionage .
nevertheless , repeating it in public breaches the duty to be hypocritical and only places  |||  american  |||  diplomacy in a bad light .
secondly , the idea of a hacker being able to acquire the deepest secrets of the most powerful country in the world represents a significant blow to the prestige of the  |||  state  |||  department .
the scandal  |||  affects  |||  both the victims and the " executioners " equally .
but let us look at the profoud nature of what has  |||  happened  |||  .
the orwellian prophecy proved completely true , since being able to be completely  |||  controlled  |||  thanks to the telephone , the hotel visited , the motorway taken and so on , the citizen became a total victim of the eye of power .
it is true , as george simmel has already said that a  |||  real  |||  secret is an empty secret and can never be discovered ; it is also true that knowing everything about the character of berlusconi or of merkel is a secret devoid of secrecy , because it is in the public domain , but to disclose , as wikileaks has done , that the secrets of hillary cliton were empty secrets , means taking away all her power .
clearly , in future , states will no longer be able to place on  |||  line  |||  secret information , which would be like posting it on a street corner .
but it is also clear that with  |||  current  |||  technologies it is useless to hope to be able to discuss confidential reports on the telephone .
how can  |||  private  |||  and confidential reports be discussed in the future ?
i know very well that for the  |||  moment  |||  my forecast is science fiction and fanciful , but i have to imagine government agents who travel discreetly by routes which cannot be checked and that they have learned messages by heart , or have concealed written information in the heel of a shoe .
i had occasion to  |||  write  |||  that technology goes forward like a crab , namely , backwards .
a century after the invention of wireless telegraphy revolutionised  |||  communications  |||  , internet re - established wire telegraphy ( telephone ) .
video cassettes ( analogue ) had enabled cinema research workers to explore a film step - by - step going backward and forward and discovering all the secrets of montage , whilst digital cd 's only  |||  allow  |||  jumping from chapter to chapter , namsly by macroportions .
with high - speed trains one can travel from rome to milan in three hours , whilst going by air a total of three - and - a - half hours are  |||  needed  |||  .
is it therefore not  |||  extraordinary  |||  that politics and communication techniques revert to horse - drawn carriages .
a last  |||  observation  |||  .
in other days the press tried to  |||  understand  |||  what was happening in secret in embassies .
now it is embassies which ask the press for confidnetial  |||  information  |||  .
climate : how france tampers with its promises of  |||  finance  |||  .
a year after the copenhagen agreement it is time to look at the observance of the promises of fast finance ( so - called fast start finance ) by  |||  developed  |||  countries .
according to the copenhagen agreemsnt ,  |||  developed  |||  countries underook to furnish 30 thousand million dollars between 2010 and 2012 .
the european union  |||  promised  |||  7.2 thousand million euros over three years and france 1.25 thousand million euros ( 420 million a year ) .
this money must , according to the copenhagen agreenment , be " new and additional " to  |||  ensure  |||  that a supplementary effort is made without detriment to public development assistance .
unfortunately , there is no agreement about what " new and  |||  additional  |||  " means .
now that the european commission has  |||  proposed  |||  a harmonisation , certain member - states including france have blocked the procedure .
today , everyone chooses what suits him / it  |||  best  |||  .
the european commission , for example , took for its reference the year 2009 ; international finance is maintained and it is adding 150 milions over 3 years as fast start finance . les financements internationaux sont maintenus , et elle y ajoute 150 millions sur trois ans au titre des financements fast  |||  start  |||  .
other countries chose similar references in  |||  terms  |||  of year , or of level of public development assistance .
in other words , there is no  |||  reference  |||  to the costs of the preceding years , or globally , of public development assistance .
concretely , the  |||  total  |||  support given by france to developing countries can remain stable ( or even decrease ) , france maintains that it is observing its commitment in respest of " new and additional " finance .
another  |||  crucial  |||  element , the separation of gifts and loans .
there , again , there is no  |||  rule  |||  and everyone chooses his own method of calculation .
|||  clearly  |||  , this is difficult to justify ; the effort is not coparable . l'effort n'est pas comparable .
if the custom of loans can be justified for certain investments which are profitable ( often projects  |||  linked  |||  to emissions which rely on more efficient technologies ) it is fallacious to call a euro which one will recoup as a donated euro .. in addiiton , only the cost of a loan to the lender country should be taken into accunt as its commitment ( equal to the rate of interest ) .
it is the only country of the union to use  |||  loans  |||  on such a massive scale .
germany is lending 46 % , whilst denmark , the netherlands and slovakia ( among  |||  others  |||  ) observe their ciommitment with 100 % as donations .
in other words , when the great majority of the european union gives 1 euro to meet its commitment , france only gives 10 centimes and  |||  regards  |||  its effort as comparable .
summing up , france operates , in its fast  |||  start  |||  finance , double blackmail : on the one hand , on the evolution of the action over time and the other hand , on the reality of the financial effort . d'une part sur l'évolution de l'action dans le temps et d'autre part sur la réalité de l'effort financier .
the manipulation of the ministry of finance ( because it appears that it is bercy that implemented the arbitrage ) could have a doubly negative impact , both within the european union ( why should the other member - states continue to give , if  |||  lending  |||  is sufficient ? ) and in the negotiations , since the developing countries are not completely duped ....
let us hope that this is not the  |||  case  |||  .
in any event , it is essential to  |||  draw  |||  lessons from this first year of early finance .
first of all , france could announce a change in its method of accountancy for 2011 and 2012 in a spirit of honouring its commitments and of  |||  equity  |||  with other european union countries .
france could change its position to  |||  become  |||  as progresisve on these stakes as it it on others .
the hope therefore rests on the new minister of the environment , mme kosciusko - morizet who will arrive in casun  |||  next  |||  week .
a surprise announcement on france 's fast start and on the view of " additionality " and the use of loans would  |||  increase  |||  the level of international confidence needed for progress in these discussions .
according to a study  |||  published  |||  o wednesday by the future generations association ( formelry movement for the rights and respect of future generations ) , a child of 10 consumes in one day 81 different chemical substances .
the balance sheet is staggering : 81 chemical substances including 42 classified as potentially or probably carcinogenic and five classified as definitely carcinogenic , as well as 37 substances able to induce endocrine disorders , according to studies by several  |||  institutions  |||  such as the international cancer research centre .
according to the associaiton , even if , in almost all cases , the legal limits of  |||  each  |||  chemical substance are not exceeded , our inquiry shows that the reality of exposure of consumers to potentially carcinogenic contaminant is worrying .
for breakfast , butter and tea with milk  |||  alone  |||  contain over ten possible and three proven carcinogenic residues and almost twenty residues potentially able to disturb the hormone system .
an apple from brazil contains traces of six  |||  chemical  |||  substances incluing a fungicide , prohibited in france .
the same applies to beans from kenya  |||  included  |||  in a luncheon , in which the study found traces of a powerful insecticide prohibited in the european union .
in addiiton , minced steak , canned tuna and even a baguette and chewing gum contained pesticides and other  |||  chemicals  |||  .
for dinner , salmon steak was the " richest , " with 34  |||  chemical  |||  residues and even the plastic plate used for warming the meal in a microwave , was not exempt .
according to the study , the  |||  final  |||  risk for the consumer in this " contaminant cocktail " is probably underestimated .
for its part , the european ecology alliance - the greens  |||  proposed  |||  , in view of the urgency of the situation , the introduction of a moratorium on the use of pesticides , in order to stop the growth of civilisation 's diseases .
in july , a study by the european food safety agency pointed to the presence of residues of 365 different pesticides  |||  identified  |||  in fruit and vegetables consumed in europe including 76 in cereals .
today , the ukraine parliament dismissed , within the code of criminal procedure amendment , the motion to revoke an article  |||  based  |||  on which the opposition leader , yulia tymoshenko , was sentenced .
the amendment that would lead to freeing the imprisoned former prime minister was revoked during second reading of the proposal for mitigation of sentences for  |||  economic  |||  offences .
in october , tymoshenko was sentenced to seven years in prison for entering into what was  |||  reported  |||  to be a disadvantageous gas deal with russia .
the verdict is not yet final ; the court will hear tymoshenko 's  |||  appeal  |||  in december .
tymoshenko claims the verdict is a  |||  political  |||  revenge of the regime ; in the west , the trial has also evoked suspicion of being biased .
the proposal to remove article 365 from the code of criminal procedure , upon which the former prime minister was sentenced , was  |||  supported  |||  by 147 members of parliament .
its ratification would  |||  require  |||  226 votes .
libya 's  |||  victory  |||
the story of libya 's liberation , or rebellion , already has its  |||  defeated  |||  .
the  |||  transitional  |||  cabinet declared itself a follower of the customary sharia law , of which we have already heard .
libya will become a crime  |||  free  |||  country , as the punishment for stealing is having one 's hand amputated .
women can forget about emancipation ;  |||  potential  |||  religious renegades will be executed ; etc.
libya will be in an  |||  order  |||  we cannot imagine and surely would not ask for .
their only excuse is that from their point of view , nato raids were not controlled by an american  |||  general  |||  , but allah , the greatness of whom they celebrated with each strike .
when winners are sought for in libya , the  |||  west  |||  is not on the list .
without the occupation , will the oil companies get libya 's  |||  black  |||  gold for next to nothing , though ?
it is quite likely that they will not . the  |||  west  |||  will then finally be able to boast about its selfless protection of human rights .
new era of  |||  crisis  |||  commences
france and the  |||  rest  |||  of europe are now in the investors " spotlight .
a statistical storm blew over  |||  europe  |||  on tuesday .
between quarters , the  |||  czech  |||  economy stagnated ; germany and france are growing .
yet the debit market is breaking  |||  records  |||  today .
investors are no longer looking at only italy ; they now focus on spain , france , austria , and  |||  others  |||  .
germany 's gdp has grown by the  |||  expected  |||  0.5 % ; and france 's by 0.4 % .
both countries also adjusted their second quarter data , where germany did better than expected ( a 0.3 %  |||  increase  |||  instead of the original 0.1 % ) . france reported a slight decrease , by 0.1 % ( the original information suggested stagnation ) .
in this year 's third quarter , the czech economy showed an interim  |||  increase  |||  of 1.5 % .
between the quarters though , the gdp stagnated . according to the czech statistical office , this confirmed the trend of a gradual slowing of  |||  economic  |||  growth .
the results are  |||  worse  |||  than estimates by analysts .
key  |||  events  |||  :
in this year 's third quarter , czech economy showed an interim  |||  increase  |||  of 1.5 % ; however , it stagnated between the quarters .
based on preliminary and seasonal data , in the third quarter , the  |||  german  |||  economy grew by 0.5 % .
between july and september , the economy of both the eurozone and the european union grew , compared to the  |||  previous  |||  quarter , by 0.2 % , which corresponds with estimates by analysts .
earnings of both italian and spanish bonds are growing towards  |||  critical  |||  limits .
even austria , netherlands , france , and belgium , etc. are  |||  beginning  |||  to experience problems .
voices are coming from germany , suggesting that ecb be the  |||  last  |||  resort creditor .
in  |||  montenegro  |||  they won 1:0 and celebrate a 200 million windfall .
|||  football  |||  representation successfully managed the toughest task of the season !
thanks to both the great čech and  |||  beautiful  |||  goal of petr jiráček , they won 1:0 .
in the second half , czech football was lucky to maintain its luxury lead from the  |||  home  |||  return match , and will again feature at the european championship .
ihned.cz watched the progress  |||  match  |||  in a detailed report .
nearly no excitement in the first  |||  half  |||  , and a great portion of luck in the other .
from the  |||  opening  |||  minutes , the game was very pugnacious .
both teams found it difficult to join in the combination ; the game remained  |||  around  |||  the mid - field line most of the time .
that was also why there was no pressure from the  |||  home  |||  team in the first half . long kicks behind the defence were neatly averted by the czech defence .
|||  iranian  |||  students are prepared to die for their country 's nuclear program
the gesture is to express their  |||  support  |||  of their country 's nuclear program against a possible israel attack .
at tuesday noon ,  |||  students  |||  ' prayers in front of the building were followed by their chanting of death to both the usa and israel .
in isfahan , iran , several hundred university students  |||  created  |||  a live chain around isfahan uranium conversion facility .
this way , they  |||  express  |||  their readiness to protect their country 's nuclear program with their own lives .
in its recent report , the international atomic energy agency ( iaea )  |||  stated  |||  that everything leads to the conclusion that iran has not stopped striving for a nuclear weapon .
possible attack on iran nuclear facilities has been  |||  discussed  |||  in israel .
in case of an attack , aimed at the highest possible paralysation of the iranian nuclear program , the targets would be ,  |||  based  |||  on israel press , the facilities in both isfahan and natanz , where the uranium is being enriched .
an obese child 's  |||  diet  |||  : no breakfast and sausage for dinner
over a  |||  third  |||  of children between 9 and 13 are overweight ; while 9 % of schoolchildren are overweight , 5 % are obese .
as a recent research  |||  shows  |||  , obese children usually come from families with unhealthy lifestyle .
again , we can see the importance of the environment and models surrounding a human being for his or her healthy  |||  development  |||  .
over 19 % of obese children had fried chips for dinner the day before the research  |||  connected  |||  to the educational event called obesity is no accident .
moreover , the families of obese children do not practise sports . however , this concerns a majority of families of  |||  current  |||  schoolchildren - only 15 % of the children said their parents find time for sports activities at least once a week .
the research took place at the end of last year 's school year ; it included almost 900 elementary school children from  |||  throughout  |||  bohemia .
it was the second year of the obesity is no accident event  |||  supported  |||  by both všeobecná zdravotní pojišťovna insurance company and unilever .
|||  proper  |||  diet and sufficient sports activities represent key defining factors causing dramatically growing number of children who are either overweight or obese .
" for example , only half of those inquired said they have five meals a day , in the breakfast - snack - lunch - snack - dinner pattern , one of the basic preconditions of  |||  correct  |||  diet , " one of the results of the research says .
experts warn that even relative details are  |||  crucial  |||  for healthy development ; such as a regular time of family breakfast .
in the  |||  czech republic  |||  , only 23 % of schoolchildren 's families have breakfast together .
in a majority of  |||  families  |||  , everyone has breakfast separately .
yet breakfast is the core of  |||  proper  |||  daily diet .
a survey has shown that fries are  |||  consumed  |||  more often in the families of obese children .
nearly everyone - regardless of their weight - drinks sweet soft drinks  |||  every  |||  day ( 70 % ) .
another part of the survey  |||  allowed  |||  selected children ( 204 boys and 172 girls from 13 schools ) to compose their own menu based on selection offered and their taste and opinions .
" especially alarming is the high popularity of sweet soft drinks , " the  |||  final  |||  report of the survey concludes .
as the  |||  main  |||  dish for lunch , pasta won very tightly over poultry .
the survey also showed that children are willing to adjust their eating habits provided they are given  |||  correct  |||  information .
" many participants from the survey control group showed a  |||  significant  |||  shift of preferences towards healthy food when completing a questionnaire after the end of the obesity is no accident educational lecture , " project results show .
this was quite significant , for example , in case of sweet soft drinks , where more children would  |||  begin  |||  to prefer plain water .
in  |||  addition  |||  , for their main course , children ticked poultry and fish more often , limiting sweet meals and dumplings .
the closer we get to the  |||  final  |||  exam , the more information and practical tasks await .
this time , together with alenka , the director , ( there is not a  |||  single  |||  man in the course ) we discussed how to dress a woman whose body is not in perfect symmetry .
one has a  |||  short  |||  neck , the other has a boyish figure without proper curves , yet another is overweight .
a stylist must know how to optically soften wide shoulders , make the neck look longer , or add the curves  |||  necessary  |||  .
we were given tips on how to accentuate the figure of women such as jennifer lopez , i.e. with bigger breasts and hips and  |||  narrow  |||  waist , and not to dress them too provocatively .
for example , if the  |||  difference  |||  between the waist and hips is such that the skirt or trousers do not fit , it is worth to have at least one piece custom - made .
you will definitely not  |||  regret  |||  the investment , as perfectly fitting clothes are priceless .
in a custom - made skirt , you will  |||  feel  |||  much better than in one that keeps shifting , rolling up , sticking out in your waist , etc.
boyish figures , on the other hand , can wear  |||  clothes  |||  with ruffling , appliqué , embroidery , or shirring .
given the abundance of such information and figure types , i am glad to have a whole week to sort it all out in my  |||  head  |||  .
|||  each  |||  of the course participants was given a celebrity to create two outfits for : day and night .
we must  |||  consider  |||  their current appearance , their fashion style , and figure type .
i am to dress miranda kerr whom you may know from the victoria 's  |||  secret  |||  campaigns .
we must cut the clothes out of magazines or find them on the internet and  |||  print  |||  and graphically process them .
moodboard , as the  |||  result  |||  is called , then expresses our personal style and attitude to graphic depiction .
this is what a stylist and designer ,  |||  mario  |||  kameník , was telling us about .
jakub  |||  reminded  |||  us that fashion is an illusion , and a stylist should be able to use this fact .
a good stylist can work with a  |||  single  |||  piece of clothing in different ways .
" play with it , " he  |||  emphasised  |||  .
however , i appreciated the following advice the most : " for your work , you need to know the rules  |||  perfectly  |||  . "
' then you can  |||  start  |||  breaking them , ' jakub told us .
here i finally understood why we drill all the definitions and rules of what to combine with what and why , while in fashion magazines we often see something  |||  else  |||  .
from ben , the photographer , i learned that a stylist must have more outfit versions  |||  prepared  |||  than the number he is to take pictures of .
now i also know that in the picture , a piece of clothing often looks and functions in combination with others completely different from  |||  reality  |||  .
we must therefore take that into consideration when  |||  creating  |||  an outfit .
honza pokorný  |||  confirmed  |||  that image and style often are half the success .
even famous people often  |||  consider  |||  it redundant ( believing it is sufficient to be good at something , and how they look at it comes second ) .
then , we are  |||  left  |||  to google and find out if the tabloids wrote something about a celebrity gaining / losing weight , etc.
our work chiefly consists of communicating with people we dress ; it is therefore  |||  important  |||  to be a good psychologist .
to be able to  |||  estimate  |||  people , not to pander , and stick to one 's opinion .
that is the bag you fasten  |||  around  |||  your waist to carry all the props you need .
aside from the obvious things , such as scissors , a sticky roller , or safety pins , it should have a nylon thread ( for the stylist to use when taking pictures of products such as purses or hats ) , special clip - ons for holding the clothes in the  |||  back  |||  in case it is too large ( pins and similar things are forbidden as they damage the clothes ) , or a sewing set .
even when taking photographs in a studio where the surface is even , the soles might get  |||  damaged  |||  - not to mention shooting outside .
you must not  |||  touch  |||  the shoes with the scissors , to avoid any damage .
this requires  |||  real  |||  skill .
mario  |||  pleased  |||  me by praising my job .
i am beginning to realise that to be a  |||  professional  |||  stylist is no piece of cake , no matter what people say .
v need for speed : the run takes place  |||  across  |||  america .
|||  review  |||
an originally carefree ride turned into a routine morning drive to work because of a  |||  series  |||  of completely superfluous and sloppy mistakes .
the ambitions were met to a certain point , but it does not matter since nobody obviously wanted to do any  |||  extra  |||  work .
typical for the nfs series though , in the end many things are different from what we  |||  expected  |||  .
the game represents a possibly decent arcade  |||  race  |||  , but the whole is burdened by several unnecessary mistakes featured in the series for a number of years .
this  |||  means  |||  they are not really mistakes , but the expression of an incomprehensible laziness of the developers .
you are introduced into a story , where the main character , jack , decides to solve some personal issues by participating in an  |||  illegal  |||  race across america .
the idea brings several interesting  |||  features  |||  .
the route is divided into ten  |||  stages  |||  , subdivided into over fifty races .
this means each race takes place on a  |||  different  |||  route , and given stages are set in varied and interesting environments .
despite the graphics being on the same level of previous parts of the  |||  series  |||  , some of the environments are very nice to look at .
still , it is  |||  nothing  |||  world - shattering .
driving through the desert , autumnal countryside , or  |||  high  |||  in snow - covered mountains is visually very pleasant though .
in addition , the races are , from time to time , enlivened by an untypical  |||  feature  |||  .
for example , in the desert , you get into a sandstorm ,  |||  significantly  |||  decreasing the visibility .
on the other hand , in the mountains , you have to be  |||  careful  |||  not to get under an avalanche .
|||  individual  |||  races are ordered fairly well .
there are just a few types , but it is  |||  sufficient  |||  .
on top of everything else you sometimes come  |||  across  |||  the police who make your efforts more difficult .
the parts  |||  outside  |||  the car are new .
they are just interactive animations , where most of the time jack is running away from someone and you need to help him by pressing the  |||  right  |||  buttons at the right time .
nothing  |||  difficult  |||  .
the driving model follows the footsteps of the previous  |||  parts  |||  .
this  |||  means  |||  that it is nothing special anymore , but it cannot be considered a negative .
so far , everything is just  |||  right  |||  .
however , after some time ,  |||  problems  |||  come .
in  |||  contrast  |||  with the driving model , the collision model is not that good .
from a game of this type , one does not expect  |||  complicated  |||  deformations and collisions , but when you have no idea , before crashing into any object , how your car will act , something is not right .
typically , when overtaking or passing cars tightly in common  |||  traffic  |||  , you sometimes lightly touch the other car . yet sometimes in nearly identical situation your car ends up in wild pirouettes .
the restarts are done so that if you crash or get far off the track , the game takes you back to the last interrupted  |||  point  |||  .
nevertheless , there are only five restarts available per  |||  each  |||  race .
if you use them up , you have to start the  |||  race  |||  from the beginning .
this makes it an aid in case  |||  something  |||  does not work out , but you cannot rely on it completely .
sometimes the restarts are not enough and you need to learn a given section of the  |||  race  |||  by heart .
for example , some turns have to be driven through in a  |||  specific  |||  way , otherwise you simply do not fit in .
the competitors have other  |||  advantages  |||  , too .
while playing the game , you find several  |||  places  |||  , where , regardless of time , the same competitor overtakes you at the very same spot .
|||  obviously  |||  , your rival has to get in front of you no matter what .
one can  |||  understand  |||  the attempt at making the game more interesting and adrenalin - filled , but it is so obvious it gets annoying quickly .
it 's a pity , because despite the simple driving model , the game is entertaining and sometimes even so full of  |||  action  |||  you do not have time to pay attention to what is happening around you .
cars are  |||  divided  |||  into three categories .
sports cars are suitable for cities ;  |||  strong  |||  american cars for straight highway sections ; and exotic supersports cars for technical driving , such as along crooked mountain tracks .
the key story mode is closely connected with the challenge mode ; these are the races in  |||  individual  |||  locations you know from the story .
here , you gain both medals and experience  |||  points  |||  for your profile , common for both challenges and the story .
various features unlock fir  |||  getting  |||  a higher driver level : starting with cars and ending with profile backgrounds .
again , the profile is interconnected with an on - line autolog function , which , among other things , compares the results you have  |||  reached  |||  with those of other players , and ensures community functions .
you and your car get into a subway tunnel ( let 's say you do ) , where you speed down the tracks in the  |||  darkness  |||  ( let 's say you do ) .
for several days , our editorial staff kept  |||  discussing  |||  whether when designing the game no one thought for a moment or whether its authors really think we are such morons .
it is a pity though , that in some dramatic moments , the recording , in some cases  |||  rather  |||  tragically , decreases .
in order to please the widest possible young audience , the soundtrack is ' flecked in from all quarters ' ; but there probably will not be many people  |||  buying  |||  the game because of its music .
|||  overall  |||  impression of need for speed : the run is quite confused .
if the game avoided those clearly redundant mistakes , we could sincerely say that the run is the  |||  best  |||  part of nfs for the past several years .
it surely is a nice entertainment , but  |||  prepare  |||  to be blinded by the mistakes with the strength of airport spotlights .

" lisbon treaty caused  |||  significant  |||  imbalance between individual institutions . "
" i did not expect it to be such a  |||  tough  |||  war . "
she  |||  proved  |||  how true she is to her " clearly and openly about europe " motto in the very first part of her lecture , where she described individual eu organs and the relationships between them in such a clear and intelligible , way that many lecturers from the uk law dept. could be jealous .
" at first , critics said he was plain , a grey office mouse who cannot  |||  fulfil  |||  any roles ; i have to say everyone was amazed at how wonderfully he acquitted his role . "
" he is a person who can listen to all twenty - seven member states , communicate with them perfectly , and who has a  |||  clear  |||  vision of where the eu should be headed . "
she explained her new position of foreign affairs and security policy representative as a reply to a question : " who is the european union ? which phone number should i  |||  call  |||  ? " ; i.e. as an important step to unification and better clarity of union 's policy towards countries such as china or india .
no one  |||  wants  |||  to ban our cheese specialties
vicenová further focused on the  |||  agenda  |||  crucial for the eu in the past , present , and near future .
she said the  |||  fall  |||  of the government at the time was a great negative causing significant damage to the czech republic .
currently ,  |||  czech  |||  representatives in the eu has been very busy .
whether the budget will be slim and frugal ; which fields will be given preference ; which countries will be  |||  supported  |||  more and which less ; all of that is on the coming agenda .
" i really do not like all the abbreviations ,  |||  foreign  |||  words , and jargon no one understands .
how are citizens supposed to understand that in brussels , people are not trying to come up with crooked or round cucumbers ,  |||  different  |||  size bananas , or that someone wants to ban our cheese specialties . '
she also wants to use the eu environment better , and get more czechs into  |||  european institutions  |||  .
multispeed  |||  europe  |||  is coming
the ambassadress says czechs are said to be euro - sceptics ; as well as people noticing the negative rather than the  |||  positive  |||  sides of things .
she wishes more czech representatives were involved in  |||  european institutions  |||  .
she thinks numerous factors are to blame : for example , the modesty of our candidates and their inability to write motivation letters ; together with low  |||  support  |||  from the czech side .
along with the success of czech presidency , she  |||  highlighted  |||  the power and cooperation of the visegrad group .
" believe me that when i meet someone from poland and hungary , and a slovak is  |||  coming  |||  to join us , the frenchman next to me says : " hey , what 's that gathering about , is that the visegrad group again ? ' and he is not happy about it in the slightest . '
" we have both countries inside and  |||  outside  |||  the eurozone . "
" we have schengen area , and we already have an institute of  |||  reinforced  |||  cooperation . "
" for the first time it was said that the  |||  countries  |||  who want are to cooperate , while those who are not willing can stand off . "
|||  brand  |||  story :
the imb innovator  |||  starts  |||  the second century of its existence
should someone search for the word that would best  |||  express  |||  the imb strategy , the closest one would probably be " long - term . "
the  |||  company  |||  's durability goes back to its first boss , a visionary , thomas j. watson sr.
he believed in his motto saying that  |||  numerous  |||  world problems can be easily solved if people are willing to think .
his motto : ' think ! ' thus become an imprint around which the life of the future giant would unfold ( as well as the  |||  name  |||  of its internal magazine that imb started to publish in 1935 ) .
" for us in imb , long - term thinking means  |||  continuous  |||  movement towards the future .
imb survived and flourished for a hundred years , because it remained true to its original values , while it was not afraid to change everything around  |||  itself  |||  .
in the second century , we hope to be able to achieve even more , " says  |||  current  |||  company director , samuel j. palmisano , on the occasion of the anniversary .
in the 1930s , watson approached employee care similarly to baťa in the czech republic - people from imb were among the first american employees to have a  |||  paid  |||  holiday , insurance from their employer , an elegant uniform , and a sophisticated system of bonuses for the best inventors and businessmen .
from the very beginning , the company was brilliant in exploiting talented people . it was one of the first  |||  world  |||  companies to abolish all discrimination , which rendered it with great selection .
consistent with the anti - discrimination strategy is the  |||  current  |||  plan expecting a woman , virginia rometty , to take over after palmisano next year .
she has been  |||  working  |||  in imb for thirty years ; she is currently a director of sales , marketing , and strategy .
in the  |||  last  |||  few years , imb has been organising jams , on - line brainstorming sessions , from which many future strategies and innovations arise .
it is no surprise that the  |||  ideas  |||  are plentiful - the company employs nearly half a million people .
|||  institution  |||  with a good reputation
company 's strong  |||  business  |||  position is ensured by its strong internal and external image .
" from the beginning , the concept of ibm was that of an institution rather than a technology company , ' a harvard  |||  business  |||  school professor and author of a book about ibm , rosabeth moss kanter , told the economist .
as the company  |||  itself  |||  says , there is a difference between entering a market and creating it .
during the hundred years , imb , or the " big blue , " as it is called in the us because of its logo , has grown into one of the largest companies in the  |||  world  |||  .
it seems to be the most universal technology company -  |||  developing  |||  hardware and software ; infrastructure ; hosting ; and consultation services within a range from servers to nanotechnologies .
it holds the most patents of all  |||  american  |||  technology companies ; five of its employees were awarded the nobel price .
its inventions  |||  include  |||  , for example , the cash point , pay card , financial swap , bar code , and floppy disc .
with about 220 billion dollars , based on market capitalisation , ibm has become the  |||  second  |||  largest technology company ( apple being number one ) this year , overrunning microsoft for the first time since 1996 .
|||  view  |||  ahead
" if your  |||  business  |||  is defined by movement forward , you cannot be emotionally attached to the past , ' says samuel j. palmisano .
this is how it differs from , for example , its competitor , microsoft , which basically stands and  |||  falls  |||  on windows , its operating system .
while in 1990 , with over a half  |||  share  |||  , it was the strongest hardware representative .
since 2000 , ibm has  |||  sold  |||  low profitable assets worth 15 billion dollars . during the same time , it has invested 58 billion dollars into purchasing of perspective technologies .
it has  |||  continued  |||  the investments even after 2008 , when the modern economic crisis first hit the world .
ibm follows the legacy of its first director , thomas j. watson , who  |||  increased  |||  the amount of investments during the great depression .
so far , imb seems to be getting through the  |||  current  |||  crisis without any harm .
since the beginning of 2008 , the price of ibm 's shares has grown by remarkable 120 per cent ; company 's net  |||  earnings  |||  have been growing continuously .
ibm  |||  history  |||  : from cheese cutter to space travel
ibm ( international  |||  business  |||  machines ) was founded in new york , a hundred years ago . its original name " computing tabulating recording corporation " was quite complicated .
it  |||  took  |||  the name of ibm in 1924 . originally , this was a brand used for company 's branches in canada and south america .
foundations for the later ibm were laid by a merger of four  |||  companies  |||  , the history of which goes back to the 1880s .
they owned technologies such as the legendary " time clock , " i.e. a clock recording the time when employees arrive and  |||  leave  |||  work .
the architect of the new company was a businessman , charles ranlett flint , who ,  |||  until  |||  1930 , also presided over the company 's board of trustees .
flint hired a director of a competing company , thomas j. watson , to  |||  help  |||  him with company management .
the leader then put the ibm 's founder in the shade - watson 's ideas  |||  remain  |||  the base for invincible company culture and identity .
watson led the company  |||  until  |||  1952 .
ibm , as its name suggests , started by  |||  producing  |||  and selling various business machines - from meat and cheese cutters to cash registers .
during the first four years of watson 's leadership , the revenue doubled to nine million dollars , and company 's  |||  vast  |||  expansion into all continents commenced .
watson became so essential for the company , that after nearly forty years , his position in the director 's  |||  chair  |||  was taken by his son , thomas watson junior .
under his leadership , ibm started to  |||  develop  |||  artificial intelligence and created the first programming language .
in 1960s , both people and computers from ibm  |||  helped  |||  nasa control space flights - to mercury , saturn , and in 1969 , man 's flight to the moon .
meanwhile , in 1964 , ibm  |||  developed  |||  the first computer family - the ibm line system / 360 .
the classic pc that defined the computer standards of the period , called ibm 5150 ,  |||  came  |||  to the market in 1981 .
twenty years later , ibm  |||  sold  |||  computer production to a chinese company , lenovo , while buying the consultant division of pricewaterhousecoopers , and thus commenced its full focus on consulting and high added value services .
in the past three years , ibm has been highly successful with its smarter planet  |||  concept  |||  .
its goal is both smart exploitation of technologies in areas that have not yet been planned for and improving the situation in  |||  traffic  |||  or town management .
for commerce , ibm has recently  |||  introduced  |||  a smarter commerce platform that helps businessmen control the whole commerce cycle .
ibm 's history is  |||  strong  |||  even in our country .
today , ibm cz also runs a  |||  strategic  |||  outsourcing centre in brno .
the headquarters for both central and eastern europe resides in prague , where there also is a  |||  world  |||  level research team focusing on voice recognition .
after her husband , josef rychtář ( 53 ) , became both the bodyguard and lover of iveta bartošová ( 45 ) , darina still hoped he would wake up and come back  |||  home  |||  .
however , she does not want to wait any longer , and set  |||  clear  |||  rules for her future life .
" pepa may return  |||  home  |||  , but no longer as my partner , " rychtářová explained .
when darina rychtářová provided shelter for bartošová in her  |||  house  |||  in summer , she probably had not the slightest idea of what was going to happen to her marriage .
moreover , he publically  |||  admitted  |||  he loved her .
rychytář does not care who his  |||  wife  |||  sleeps with
even if one day rychtář and bartošová would split up , his wife will not welcome him with  |||  open  |||  arms .
" he is the biological father to my sons and if he wants to spend his last days in our  |||  house  |||  , no one will chase him out . "
" however , he will complete his days not as my beloved , lost and found old fool , but as a person i have  |||  certain  |||  bonds to , " rychtářová said , adding she had already disengaged herself from her husband and only insists on mutual decency .
" i  |||  respect  |||  my wife 's decision . "
" my wife decided for marriage on paper , and i  |||  respect  |||  it . "
" darina and i communicate in a completely  |||  normal  |||  way , only we do not share our bed anymore , " rychtář said for blesk .
he claims that if rychtářová found a new  |||  love  |||  , he would not stand in her way .
" we do n't sleep together , and i do n't care where she goes , with  |||  whom  |||  , and if she has a boyfriend .
i know it 's my fault , i fell in love with iveta , and i accept  |||  full  |||  responsibility , " josef concluded .
the worst feminine habits : do they  |||  concern  |||  you ?
when you ask men to  |||  name  |||  some typical bad habits women have , they usually come up with all of them in an instant .
|||  shopping  |||
does your other half complain you are addicted to  |||  shopping  |||  ?
do you need to buy at least one piece of clothing a  |||  week  |||  ?
do you like shopping , in  |||  mass  |||  sales ?
if so , then your  |||  shopping  |||  may be seen as bad habit .
shopping may be a hobby for a majority of women , but for men , it may  |||  become  |||  absolute hell .
do you find these  |||  sentences  |||  familiar ?
then , you  |||  belong  |||  to the group of women obsessed by their appearance .
not that you should  |||  stop  |||  looking after yourself , but many men are literary allergic to their partners " constant complaints about their looks .
the stronger sex also agrees that the higher the  |||  frequency  |||  of such complaints , the more annoying women are .
|||  order  |||  and cleanliness first
cleaning the windows , vacuuming , wiping the floors , dusting , scrubbing the bathtub - at  |||  least  |||  twice a week .
in case you suffer from this " deviation , " try to realise that no extremes are good ; and that within your family ,  |||  order  |||  and cleanliness should not go first .
this harmless desire for cleanliness may threaten your relationships , as well as the entire  |||  family  |||  .
" do you plan to wear the dirty socks  |||  tomorrow  |||  ? "
maybe , if men realised that ,  |||  women  |||  would not have to boss them around so much ...
women are  |||  focused  |||  on relationships , which is why they like to discuss who , where , who with , how , and why .
let 's be frank , this is probably the nature all  |||  women  |||  .
assists of jágr and voráček  |||  helped  |||  philadelphia 's victory
during monday 's nhl  |||  match  |||  , hockey forward , jaromír jágr 's two assists helped philadelphia 's victory 5:3 on carolina 's ice . again , he leads the productivity of czech players in the game .
after the  |||  match  |||  , jágr told the overseas journalists he had predicted a great evening for giroux .
" i  |||  told  |||  him before the match he would score a hat - trick . "
" i  |||  felt  |||  it . "
" you sometimes  |||  feel  |||  such things , " explained jágr , after whose action giroux scored a goal on the first flyers " shot .
a little bit later ,  |||  second  |||  score for the team bore czech traces too .
the trailing hurricanes ' voráček won the puck and  |||  presented  |||  it to maxim talbot , who scored between the circles .
a second before the first break , a  |||  home  |||  player , patrick dwyer , narrowed the lead in a power - play , but the beginning of the second part was led by flyers again .
|||  specifically  |||  by giroux .
after assist with jágr , he scored the third goal ; consequently , his shot was touched into a  |||  fourth  |||  goal by wayne simmonds .
" i love  |||  playing  |||  with him . "
" i do n't ; want to say he 's the best league player , but he 's definitely among the best three , " said jágr , complimenting his  |||  center  |||  .
" i never thought that at the end of my  |||  career  |||  i would play with a hockey player like him . "
" it makes me  |||  happy  |||  . "
" all those years in nhl , my team - mates tried to assist me , and now its reversing , " jágr  |||  added  |||  .
carolina made the match more dramatic with tuomo ruutu and dwyer 's goal from a penalty shot , making it a  |||  single  |||  goal difference .
further complications were avoided by matt  |||  read  |||  who increased the difference to two points .
" pronger did great in our  |||  zone  |||  . "
" he poked out the puck , i gained speed , and  |||  read  |||  went on to the more distant pole . "
" i aimed at him , and i 'm glad it worked , " voráček described his  |||  view  |||  of the last goal of the match .
its victory moved philadelphia onto the top of the eastern  |||  conference  |||  .
czech montreal defenseman , jaroslav špaček , did not finish the match with buffalo ; he left in the second period due to an upper  |||  body  |||  injury .
along with the experienced back , the candiens lost their two - goal lead and  |||  lost  |||  2:3 after a penalty shoot - out .
more than  |||  lost  |||  points , the home trainer was sorry for high sick rate in the back , as the match was finished with just five defenders .
" we finished the match with just one  |||  experienced  |||  player , the rest were young men . "
" however , there is nothing we can do about that , we just have to  |||  face  |||  it , " jacques martin said .
with thirty interventions , czech goalie , ondřej pavelec ,  |||  helped  |||  winnipeg 's 5:2 victory over tampa bay .
until 1989 , only five state travel agencies were  |||  allowed  |||  in the former czechoslovakia : čedok , sporturist , ckm , rekrea , and autoturist .
as travelling to the west was strictly limited , travel agencies of the time mostly  |||  sold  |||  tours to the socialist block countries .
for their holiday , czech tourists thus went to the sea to the  |||  german  |||  democratic republic ; soviet union ( sochi , crimea near the black sea ) ; bulgaria ; romania ( both to the black sea ) ; and hungary ( balaton ) .
a great paradox of the socialistic period was that citizens of the socialist block ( i.e. czechoslovaks too ) were not  |||  allowed  |||  free individual travel within the socialist countries .
at the time , travel agencies would  |||  offer  |||  some trips to the west , but one either had to stand in a line overnight , with a sleeping bag or have some " good friends " in the agency .
czechoslovakian currency was not freely convertible ; without the currency assurance , it was not  |||  possible  |||  to obtain financial means ( western currency ) for travelling west .
while until 1989 , a holiday in the gdr or bulgaria was the climax of our travels , last year , czechs  |||  spent  |||  4.5 million holidays in countries all over the world .
right at the beginning of 1990 , visa requirements for neighbouring west european countries were cancelled . this started a  |||  huge  |||  wave of short - term visits of chiefly vienna and germany .
czechoslovaks could not get enough of travelling to the west .  |||  everyone  |||  wanted to go there for at least a moment .
for example , in paris , czech tours slept in parks in tents , because their income at the time was not enough to pay for a hotel or a  |||  pension  |||  .
a typical feature of czech tourism then was bringing their own  |||  food  |||  ( cans , salami , etc. ) to save money .
another important  |||  moment  |||  was the introduction of freely convertible czech crown . after decades , our tourists thus finally able to freely buy western currencies .
since 1997 ,  |||  increased  |||  demand allowed travel agencies to prepare regular trips by charter airlines . compared to the past , air trips thus became unbelievably cheap due to the ability to order quantity discounts .
by the end of 1990s , czechs did not need visa for visiting nearly all  |||  developed  |||  world countries , except for the usa . this made our travelling even easier .
the next significant event in the history of after revolution travelling  |||  came  |||  in 2000 . high demand resulted in the historically first direct charter flight from the czech republic to an exotic country , thailand .
|||  currently  |||  about 100 thousand czechs visit exotic countries every year !
yet another important event of this period , symbolising our development after the revolution ,  |||  came  |||  in 2008 .
for the first time in history , in 2008 czechs  |||  spent  |||  more than a half of their holidays abroad ( 50.3 % ) ; and for the first time in history , they spent over 15 thousand crowns per person per holiday abroad , including their costs at the destination .
general meeting should find a president , mate  |||  threat  |||  returns
for nearly five months , czech football has had no president . there exists a risk that ivan hašek 's successor , the head of czech republic 's football association ( fačr ) will not be  |||  known  |||  even after another extraordinary general meeting , which is to take place in nymburk on thursday .
without it , voting for the  |||  three  |||  candidates will not start .
hašek resigned from his function in june . when  |||  leaving  |||  , he called to his colleagues to unite and find a strong personality who would lead football in the future .
however , hašek 's era sees football back in quarrels between both association chambers , unable to  |||  agree  |||  on a common candidate .
this was fully  |||  shown  |||  on september 16 , when a new president was to be chosen .
general meeting delegates wasted their trip to the  |||  national  |||  house in prague , smíchov , as the negotiations remained blocked , not just regarding the election method .
no agreement was reached as to who is entitled to vote at the general meeting - whether the statutory representatives only , or also  |||  officials  |||  given power of attorney .
this single  |||  point  |||  has been partially settled since , thanks to a recommendation of the institute of state and law , according to which representation based on power of attorney is not possible .
arguments concerning the  |||  election  |||  rules continue , though .
the  |||  view  |||  of election options has changed several times , but the key point remains the same .
" the argument is based on whether to follow the by - laws or to find another model , " says one of the three fačr vice - presidents , dušan svoboda , who represents  |||  professional  |||  football in the association 's management .
|||  based  |||  on the model given by the by - laws , the winner of the 3rd round is a candidate with higher percentage support from the chamber he is the candidate for .
moravia is said to accept a compromise to have a  |||  candidate  |||  with the highest percentage of total votes from both chambers win the election .
' i wish the elections follow the by - laws to the  |||  maximum  |||  . '
" i want to avoid all kinds of representative nonsense , as at the  |||  previous  |||  general meeting , " says the owner of viktorie plzeň , who is a candidate for the first time ; and in his statements he chiefly stood against pelta .
pelta  |||  remains  |||  an optimist .
he believes the new president will be  |||  known  |||  in nymburk ; he also hopes that in the future , the candidates will cooperate constructively .
" all passionate stirring will calm down with today 's prospective advance of the national  |||  team  |||  into the european championship . "
" football will be back on the  |||  happy  |||  wave , people will be more willing to cooperate , " a jablonec functionary says . of the three candidates , he has the most experience with football management on both professional and regional levels .
" i hope for an  |||  agreement  |||  , but the situation is very ambivalent . "
" it is not between people from bohemia and moravia , but there are attempts at purposeful  |||  adjustment  |||  of regulations . "
" that may  |||  cause  |||  another blockage of the general meeting . "
" i hope the common sense  |||  wins  |||  , " rajchl said .
some negotiations are said to have taken place directly in montenegro ; but who knows if the football generality will be  |||  complete  |||  before the match .
an extra flight that was to take , among  |||  others  |||  , the vice presidents dalibor kučera and rajchl to podgorica did not leave prague in the morning due to a technical failure . an alternative was sought for in order to transport part of the executive board to the scene of the barraged rematch .
finally , a meeting at ministry level , said to  |||  happen  |||  on wednesday , may decide .
paclík enters the presidential fight as he cannot see a suitable  |||  candidate  |||
paclík 's motivation to join the fight with miroslav pelta and jindřich rajchl is to try to  |||  prevent  |||  pelta , reportedly the favourite of the elections , from entering the top of the fačr .
in the future , he would like to see the position given to an  |||  experienced  |||  top manager , not excessively connected to football life .
" i 've spoken to some people that could be  |||  considered  |||  . "
" i was terrible for me to hear some of them say that at this  |||  point  |||  , they do n't even want to identify themselves with czech football . "
" i 'd like to  |||  change  |||  this opinion , " he said .
at the moment , paclík 's strongest disagreement with pelta is based on the latter 's connection to roman berbr , president of pilsen 's regional football association . berber is a man of controversial reputation , who is , behind the scenes , known as  |||  powerful  |||  lobbyist , capable of influencing the votes of general meeting delegates .
" if he wins ,  |||  current  |||  situation will be preserved and nothing in football would move forward . "
" i do n't know what prestige pelta 's victory would bring to  |||  football  |||  . "
in case paclík wins on thursday , he could imagine cooperation with pelta in the  |||  future  |||  .
" i can see him as the head of the  |||  representation  |||  . "
' but he cannot  |||  manage  |||  the association . '
" i do n't poke my nose in what i do n't understand either , ' said paclík , who gained a lot of attention in september , when he supported the removal of board of referees , led by luděk macela ,  |||  replaced  |||  by dagmar damková .
he refers to his skills from management of private companies ; since last summer , he has been managing the pilsen team that , with his  |||  support  |||  , celebrated its first league triumph in may .
" i have the strength to make the football environment  |||  change  |||  , to support its improvement . "
" to limit the influence of some interest groups that tend to influence the disciplinary and  |||  appeal  |||  board , leading to disgusting situations , " paclík said . he does not hide his antipathy for , e.g. sparta 's director , daniel křetínský .
one of his priorities would be the strengthening of relations between fačr and the czech olympic committee , with whose  |||  support  |||  he would lobby at the political top to get more money for sports from the lottery tax .
" that 's one of the key  |||  things  |||  the new president should attend to . "
" if taxes are imposed on gambling , as the political parties  |||  declare  |||  , i understand their arguments , but they must clearly say where the money will go , " he said .
paclík does not consider his connection with the pilsen club a burden ,  |||  though  |||  he claims that an fačr president should be a non - party one .
pelta is connected to jablonec , and rajchl to  |||  prague  |||  dukla .
" it 's not  |||  ideal  |||  . "
" yet , i do n't see a  |||  point  |||  in transferring my shares in the pilsen club hypocritically to someone else , while coming back there in six months , " paclík says .
|||  before  |||  the thursday negotiations in nymburk , a jablonec functionary remains an optimist and believes that the pre - election fight would be significantly suppressed by today 's prospective success of our football representation .
prior to the failed election in september , pelta promised that if he was to win , he would  |||  focus  |||  on both the representation and gaining of financial means .
he decided to participate in the elections before the last general meeting at the last  |||  moment  |||  . a two - month delay thus could have been useful for him to defend his ideas concerning football management in wider context .
" people at all levels have been in football for long , and they expect the president to be  |||  known  |||  on thursday . "
he believes  |||  current  |||  problems with elections are caused by the euphoria there was in the time of ivan hašek 's reign .
" unfortunately , regulations that were not as perfect as we all  |||  thought  |||  were passed at the general meeting in june . "
he approached the rewriting of the key document of the  |||  civil  |||  association as a decoy for the delegates .
" it is a fundamental  |||  issue  |||  we cannot exist without , " pelta claims .
in the past , he has already announced he can imagine his cooperation with jindřich rajchl ,  |||  whom  |||  he recognises for his legal education ; he is well aware of the fact that his rival candidate should become his first vice president .
" he 's been in football for over a year , and  |||  gained  |||  some success . "
" however , his attacks were not decent , and many people were caught by surprise by the  |||  method  |||  of his election campaign . "
he sees his strongest weapon in knowledge of  |||  football  |||  , from the lowest competitions to representation .
the representation should be the shopping window of  |||  football  |||  .
he then  |||  promised  |||  that his arrival to the head of the football would not mean any personnel housecleaning .
despite  |||  current  |||  catastrophic scenarios accompanying the general meeting planned , he believes that on thursday , the delegates will not come to nymburk in vain .
" if the only questionable  |||  point  |||  is how to perform the elections in the third round that is something we can get over . "
" football needs trustworthiness it can only gain by finally having its leader , " says pelta , who , two days before the  |||  crucial  |||  day of his career of a functionary , remains an optimist .
rajchl promises that under him , the fačr will  |||  start  |||  working hard
if , on thursday 's general meeting , jindřich rajchl , the  |||  existing  |||  vice president , is to become the president of czech football association , many people in the association would reportedly not be pleased .
rajchl promises that if he is  |||  elected  |||  , hard work will come .
he wants to establish system changes and make members of the executive board  |||  responsible  |||  for individual football areas .
he also promised to solve the bohemians case ; improve relations with both uefa and fifa ; bring more money to football ; and continue the work of the  |||  previous  |||  president , ivan hašek .
" as president , i 'd like to focus on football as a  |||  whole  |||  . "
" from international contacts with uefa and fifa , to representation ,  |||  professional  |||  football , and performance football for the youth . "
" i 'm a team player , and i want to distribute the competences within the executive board so that  |||  each  |||  member focuses on a certain area . "
' i 'll distribute tasks strictly so that in  |||  each  |||  of these segments , football makes big steps forward . "
" that would probably not please many people , as it would mean  |||  hard  |||  work , not just criticizing of the work of others , " he added .
" but i need to know if it has any sense ; and that i wo n't be surrounded by people throwing sticks under my feet and question my every  |||  move  |||  , " he explained his hesitation .
moreover , he says his motivation is to  |||  continue  |||  the work he started with hašek .
" processes have been started that may bear fruit in a few years , and i do n't want someone else to stop them , " he said , in fear that if the other candidate , miroslav pelta , is  |||  elected  |||  , situation f the association might return to the period before hašek .
" i  |||  believe  |||  in systematic approach , which is something i do n't think mirek pelta is competent of . "
" i can be blamed for many things , but  |||  certainly  |||  not for being subjective . "
" i try to be  |||  objective  |||  . "
furthermore , he refutes the allegations he would only be a  |||  czech  |||  president .
"  |||  though  |||  some people try to claim the opposite , i plan to do the maximum for moravia . "
" for example , it is high time to  |||  consider  |||  about splitting the second league into czech and moravian parts , winners of which would continue into the first league . "
" this would prevent the  |||  current  |||  situation , where there are just three moravian units in the league , which is a problem concerning young players in moravia , " rajchl said .
while claiming that pelta has been ' disqualified from returning trustworthiness to czech football ' , he considers the other rival , paclík , a  |||  strong  |||  candidate that has things to offer .
" if he is elected , i hope he would continue in the things ivan hašek started , without  |||  significant  |||  personnel changes in the committees . "
europe 's most beautiful  |||  pools  |||
paddling pools with universal fibre optics and status pools in budapest . travellers can experience europe 's incredible water - and relax tired limbs in a jacuzzi after a  |||  city  |||  tour or a ramble .
there was one thing iris meder could not do without on research trips over the  |||  last  |||  one and a half years : her swimming costume .
she rushed to add any pool she liked to her notebook - with essential details on the construction and the history of the  |||  building  |||  .
the architectural historian meder looked at more than 200 swimming pools - and has now compiled here experiences in her recently published book badefreuden ( the joys of bathing ) , covering everything from public swimming baths in munich to  |||  historical  |||  bathing palaces in the black forest and " hardcore concrete buildings " in taunus .
her " journey to the most unusual baths in  |||  central  |||  europe " took here through 13 countries . besides germany , austria and switzerland , she visited baths in italy , france , the czech republic , slovakia , slovenia , hungary , romania and poland - and one city each in luxembourg , serbia and croatia .
the 46 - year - old is a  |||  real  |||  bathing culture enthusiast .
she has very  |||  little  |||  enthusiasm for sport , says meder - but in the water , it 's a different matter .
" so i  |||  started  |||  collecting beautiful baths . "
water surface doubles  |||  architecture  |||
splashing in the diving  |||  pool  |||  and ethereal sauna oils - the wellness factor in baths is so great because all the senses are stimulated , according to meder .
and swimming baths can be a  |||  real  |||  treat for the eyes if the builders have gone to the trouble . " you have the surface of the water in pools instead of a floor . "
" the surface is very transparent , but also reflects the beauty of the entire  |||  building  |||  . "
everything is mirrored visually :  |||  high  |||  ceilings , colourful tiles and diving boards .
she found nitrate - rich water in a karst cave ( the cave bath in miskolctapolca ) and a thermal bath filled with alkaline water in a bottle - shaped  |||  building  |||  ( városi termálfürdö in jászberény ) in addition to magnificent therapeutic baths such as the 100 - year - old széchenyi baths in budapest .
perhaps the most unusual  |||  pool  |||  design awaits bathers in längenfeld . the aqua dome in ötztal looks like a ufo has just landed in the alps .
it steams during the winter from three  |||  open  |||  - topped shells dwarfed by the ötztal mountains behind it .
pool collector meder was not greeted by the smell of chlorine in  |||  every  |||  swimming pool .
the smell comes from the hydrogen carbonate in the alkaline water . the water is almost black with silt that sticks to the skin as soon as you slide into the pool - a wellness experience of a  |||  particular  |||  kind .
the baths , designed by the architect dušan jurkovic in 1902 , have been  |||  closed  |||  .
when meder looked through the weather - beaten windows of the red , white and yellow art nouveau building , she could see weeds  |||  growing  |||  up through the tiles .
the baths have already gone through three stages of  |||  construction  |||  . you will not only discover neo - romanesque elements from the period after it was built in 1844 , but also a moorish hall in alhambra style added around 1900 .
following its careful modernisation in 1995 , the palais thermal is the favourite swimming pool of pool connoisseur iris meder - and not just because she  |||  comes  |||  from the black forest .
" it is a real achievement to harmonise such  |||  different  |||  architectural styles so brilliantly , " says meder .
agricultural commodities  |||  speculation  |||
deutsche bank has commodity  |||  trading  |||  investigated
will deutsche bank stop  |||  trading  |||  agricultural commodities ?
according to spiegel online , josef ackermann has given a  |||  working  |||  group the task of investigating the consequences of speculation for the poor around the world .
|||  hamburg  |||  -
for german citizens the situation is  |||  clear  |||  . according to one study , 84 percent of germans find it unacceptable that banks speculate on agricultural commodities such as wheat and maize .
two thirds of those questioned  |||  demand  |||  that deutsche bank and other banks cease trading in agricultural commodities , as trading deepens the problems faced by the very poorest people around the world .
the findings were made in a survey conducted by the forsa institute for social research and statistical analysis on behalf of the  |||  consumer  |||  organisation foodwatch .
the study is based on a report  |||  presented  |||  by foodwatch in mid - october .
the author of the report , harald schumann , shows that betting on  |||  global  |||  commodities exchanges drives up prices - and the banks are therefore complicit in global hunger .
originally , commodity betting was designed as a means of protecting traders against  |||  price  |||  fluctuations .
however , most experts now  |||  agree  |||  that the gamblers have left behind the rules of supply and demand - and are profiting at the expense of the poorest .
according to spiegel online , an international  |||  working  |||  group is currently investigating the accusations contained in the foodwatch report .
the head of the  |||  bank  |||  then plans to announce changes following the investigation at the end of january .
ackermann  |||  working  |||  on his image
the president of foodwatch , thilo bode , welcomed the news while emphasising his criticism of the financial sector . " betting on  |||  rising  |||  food prices is an extreme example of how thoughtlessly banks are currently acting against the common interest . "
as top  |||  bank  |||  lobbyist , ackermann has a particular duty , according to bode .
" deutsche bank must remove all investments from its portfolio that bet money on  |||  food  |||  prices , " said bode .
" it does not matter whether this is about starving people or the reputation of deutsche  |||  bank  |||  . "
ackermann 's sensitive response is at first surprising , but then the ceo would like to present a  |||  perfect  |||  image just a few months before the end of his term in office .
deutsche bank announced on monday that the chairman will not move to the supervisory board as had been  |||  planned  |||  .
cancelling contentious food commodity speculation could  |||  improve  |||  his image .
foodwatch is striving to  |||  keep  |||  up the pressure on the manager .
to  |||  date  |||  , more than 30,000 internet users have joined the organisation 's campaign .
bode  |||  published  |||  the survey on tuesday . the survey was conducted for the forsa institute for social research and statistical analysis on 7 and 8 november and 1001 people took part .
no more than eleven percent think it is legitimate for deutsche bank to  |||  offer  |||  investments that bet on the price of foodstuffs .
many banking customers would also take direct action if they discover that their bank is  |||  involved  |||  in such trading . according to the survey , one in two would withdraw investments that end up in commodities speculation .
43 percent would recommend leaving the bank , 49 percent said they would think about closing their account and switching to a  |||  different  |||  bank .
21er haus in  |||  vienna  |||
the relocated  |||  pavilion  |||
an architectural history with highs , lows and a  |||  happy  |||  - ever - after . austria 's pavilion for the 1958 world 's fair in brussels won prizes , became a museum in vienna , stood empty and was abandoned .
it made the architect so famous that he also  |||  built  |||  austria 's pavilion at the next world 's fair .
the pavilion , planned as a temporary exhibition building , was relocated to the schweizer garten near vienna 's südbahnhof , converted and  |||  opened  |||  as the museum of the 20th century in 1962 - and is widely referred to as the " 20er haus " for this reason .
however , the  |||  building  |||  was not suitable as a museum for technical and spatial reasons - it had no walls to hang artworks and poor air conditioning .
the  |||  building  |||  stood empty from 2001 and fell into a worse and worse state of repair .
the museum is a branch of the belvedere museum , which will  |||  open  |||  the first exhibition on tuesday evening - a delight in every respect .
agnes husslein - arco who became the new director of the  |||  austrian  |||  galerie belvedere in 2007 was instrumental in the new beginning .
he was known , of course , for having renovated and  |||  expanded  |||  joseph olbrich 's secession in vienna , and had won the competition , but he also studied under schwanzer at the vienna university of technology and the pavilion was an " exceptionally important place " for him where had visited exhibitions " almost every weekend . "
he knew the original design and knew the issues the building was facing , a building that had already  |||  lost  |||  some of its grandeur and lightness when it was relocated to vienna and converted .
the problems facing the latest alterations were much greater . the  |||  building  |||  was " an energy guzzler , " says krischanitz .
two lower floors created space for the new use of the building , a sunken light well between the  |||  building  |||  and the street provides lighting , a bridge leads to the entrance - almost a new building , but still the delicate schwanzer pavilion .
the original external doors have been retained and the  |||  building  |||  has been painted in the old red - brown colour of rust - proofing .
" we often had to find a material that was good , cheap and met with the approval of the monument  |||  authority  |||  , " says krischanitz , pointing to the rough flooring in the basement .
the building has  |||  remained  |||  flexible and light despite the constraints , problems and conversions .
krischanitz stated recently that the pavilion " from brussels " had been  |||  tough  |||  - a typical " drop in the city " story .
architecture like this is " always in the  |||  wrong  |||  place " and nonetheless wants to " stimulate a real awareness . "
there may also be a second stroke of luck . the 21er haus may be bolstered by another krischanitz building - the collector francesca von habsburg has purchased the temporäre kunsthalle berlin and is reported to be  |||  negotiating  |||  with the city for a neighbouring location in the schweizer garten .
deutsche bahn plans  |||  winter  |||  crisis package into the millions
deutsche bahn has come up with a crisis plan to prevent  |||  train  |||  cancellations in the winter .
the costs will run into the  |||  millions  |||  .
according to a newspaper report , deutsche bahn will spend more than 70 million euros more this year in the  |||  battle  |||  to prevent winter - time cancellations and delays .
referring to an internal crisis plan at deutsche bahn , the bild newspaper has reported that investment of around 300 million euros in  |||  total  |||  is planned up to 2015 .
the number of internal and external employees involved in removing snow from rail facilities and platforms is to  |||  double  |||  to 16,000 .
the aim is to clear platforms of snow and ice by  |||  start  |||  of business and 90 percent of the critical points within four to five hours .
rüdiger grube , head of deutsche bahn , warned of  |||  train  |||  cancellations and delays this winter at a summit with government and industry two months ago .
last winter , deutsche bahn had considerable  |||  difficulties  |||  in its passenger business , as it lacked reserves in the face of difficult weather conditions .
|||  numerous  |||  new regional trains have been waiting for years for approval from the federal railway office .
there is also some  |||  delay  |||  in the delivery of ice trains .
deutsche bahn has also been forced to have the axles of ice trains checked significantly more frequently for many years , after an ice  |||  train  |||  's axle broke in cologne 's main station .
deutsche bank pays multi - million pound  |||  fine  |||  in the usa
as if the problems at home were not already enough for deutsche bank , the industry giant 's past in the usa is now also catching up with it . frankfurt - based deutsche bank will pay 145 million dollars ( 106 million euros ) to settle disputes arising from the bankruptcy of five  |||  major  |||  credit unions during the financial crisis .
the issue centres on the  |||  sale  |||  of mortgage securities .
the national credit union administration ( ncua ) , a financial market regulator , accuses a string of  |||  major  |||  banks of having used false promises to mislead credit unions into buying the financial products .
" we are  |||  happy  |||  to have resolved the issue without the parties going to court , " said a deutsche bank spokesman in new york .
the ncua is fighting for  |||  compensation  |||  for losses that run into the billions .
the  |||  current  |||  settlements are the first of their kind .
this sealed the fate of a  |||  number  |||  of financial companies when the us property bubble exploded in 2007 .
the banks battling against a strong  |||  wind  |||  in the usa several years later .
investors and regulators have brought a vast  |||  number  |||  of claims for compensation or to punish misconduct .
deutsche bank also faces legal action by the fhfa covering multiple transactions with a  |||  total  |||  value of 14.2 billion dollars from 2005 to 2007 .
the regulator is demanding that the frankfurt - based bank take responsibility for "  |||  substantial  |||  losses , " but has not yet specified the exact sum .
deutsche bank has  |||  rejected  |||  the claims as baseless and has declared its intention to fend off the claims .
warren buffett pumps 10  |||  billion  |||  into ibm
financial guru buffett is investing heavily in the it  |||  company  |||  , ibm .
until now , the  |||  major  |||  american investor , warren buffett , had always claimed not to invest in it and computing companies , as it was difficult to forecast the long - term development .
according to buffett , he should have realised much earlier that ibm primarily offers services and purchases  |||  computer  |||  systems for the it departments of other companies .
investment by warren buffett is considered a knighthood in the financial  |||  world  |||  .
he praised the management , which has managed to bring in profits even during the  |||  economic  |||  crisis .
" they have done a great job , " said buffett , referring to the management  |||  strategy  |||  .
buffett had avoided technology firms to  |||  date  |||  .
he claimed only to invest in companies  |||  whose  |||  business he understands
and invested in a freight railway , for example , a lubricant manufacturer and a  |||  machine  |||  manufacturer .
the 81 - year - old took over the small textile company berkshire hathaway in the 1960s and  |||  built  |||  it up , with clever investments , into one of the most valuable companies in the world .
his  |||  lifestyle  |||  , however , has remained humble ,
making him a cult figure for countless investors  |||  around  |||  the world .
his almost infallible instinct for making  |||  money  |||  has earned him a nickname as the " oracle from omaha . "
buffett , however , has said he is not planning to invest in  |||  microsoft  |||  .
the founder ,  |||  bill  |||  gates , is a close friend .
following the discovery of the " zwickau cell , " turkish media express  |||  doubt  |||  about the rule of law in germany .
one newspaper speaks of a "  |||  bloody  |||  ideology " that is now resurfacing .
the murder of eight turkish and one  |||  greek  |||  businessman between 2000 and 2006 was the result of right - wing extremist ideology .
fear and concern has been the reaction to this  |||  report  |||  in turkey and within the german - turkish community in germany .
for many  |||  german  |||  turks , the news brings back to life a long - dead spectre . there has been no comparable right - wing extremist violence against turks since the arson attacks in mölln in november 1992 and in solingen in may 1993 .
there was never any question , however , that xenophobia does exist in  |||  germany  |||  .
" is this a revival of the bloody ideology ? " was the headline of the internet edition of the  |||  turkish  |||  newspaper haberturk .
the sabah newspaper , on the other hand , points out that one of the perpetrators was a confidential informant for the intelligence services and expresses concern that the  |||  german  |||  authorities may be caught up in the right - wing extremist quagmire .
the turkish community of germany ( tgd ) reacted calmly , remembering the victims of racial violence during a silent vigil in  |||  front  |||  of the brandenburg gate at the weekend .
just two weeks earlier , the turkish community in berlin had commemorated the fiftieth anniversary of the  |||  german  |||  - turkish bilateral agreement on labour recruitment in a ceremony with german and turkish politicians .
the coverage by some turkish media has been like a slap in the face . " germany 's  |||  present  |||  on the fiftieth anniversary " is the title of one article on the haber x turkish internet platform , which comments on the circumstances around the series of murders .
the  |||  german  |||  edition of hürriyet also does not miss the chance to make this connection .
he points out that people have been murdered who had  |||  paid  |||  taxes and made an important contribution to germany 's redevelopment with their work .
the authors are asking themselves why the  |||  german  |||  authorities did not think earlier to look for suspects in right - wing extremist circles .
some writers even go as far as some strong rhetoric . " if things continue to be done so cack - handedly , migrants have no option but armed  |||  self  |||  - defence . "
" peace in germany depends very  |||  strongly  |||  on how the entire network is uncovered and on the appropriateness of punishment , " writes " selen . "
the attacks , however , increased the sense of  |||  turkish  |||  unity .
the turkish press at the time complained mainly of the  |||  failure  |||  of german policy following the attacks . helmut kohl declined to visit the survivors in mölln .
he  |||  sent  |||  a telegram of commiseration to the turkish president after the arson attack in solingen , but it was his foreign minister , klaus kinkel , who took his place at the memorial ceremony in cologne - kinkel summed up in his speech the taxes turks contribute in germany ,
just as if he were calculating the  |||  value  |||  of a person by the taxes he pays .
the coverage by the turkish  |||  media  |||  at the time again shows how deep the mistrust of many german turks in the current german state has become since .
the most risk - taking bank in  |||  europe  |||  is not in italy or france , but in switzerland .
ubs almost went bankrupt during the financial crisis and has been struggling from one crisis to the  |||  next  |||  ever since .
a  |||  german  |||  is now to bring it back in line .
axel weber  |||  certainly  |||  had not imagined that would be his role .
" i am looking forward to  |||  working  |||  with kaspar villiger and oswald grübel . "
but by september it was already clear that everything would be very  |||  different  |||  .
a ubs trader in london had bypassed all the bank 's security systems and gambled away  |||  around  |||  1.7 billion euros .
ubs ceo , oswald grübel - a banker not only famous in  |||  switzerland  |||  - had to go .
the ubs chairman has been considered ailing ever since - and everyone is  |||  asking  |||  : when will axel weber finally arrive ?
|||  weber  |||  is to advise the bank from february 2012 .
that will be  |||  tough  |||  for axel weber .
he is an  |||  economics  |||  professor and central banker , not a conventional banker , and clearly would need some time to adjust .
ubs is both  |||  huge  |||  - it was the biggest asset manager in the world until recently - and has been struggling from one scandal to the next for years .
the  |||  proud  |||  swiss bank , it seems , is to be spared nothing .
it  |||  began  |||  in the financial crisis .
as a result , in 2007 ubs was managing 1.6 billion , thereby managing more more money from wealthy clients than any other  |||  bank  |||  in the world ,
and had risen to the league of the  |||  world  |||  's biggest banks as an investment bank .
" from what we know today , you have to ask how i could be so  |||  wrong  |||  . "
in the  |||  middle  |||  of the year , ceo peter wuffli - considered a highly intellectual and equally brilliant banker - suddenly stepped down .
the  |||  investment  |||  division of the bank had gambled on subprime securities and was forced to write off billions .
ubs announced a capital  |||  increase  |||  , believe it or not , of 13 billion swiss francs to face the crisis .
the bank actually managed to find investors , but investors many bankers would have respectfully declined a short while earlier - a less than transparent asian sovereign wealth fund from singapore and an arabic sovereign wealth fund that was so secretive , even its  |||  name  |||  was not disclosed .
the bank was forced to announce new losses running into the billions and chairman of the board of directors , marcel ospel - the  |||  second  |||  best paid chairman in switzerland in 2006 - resigned .
after all , the balance sheet total for ubs in 2007 was more than five times the  |||  economic  |||  output of switzerland ( see chart ) .
" we would not be able to  |||  save  |||  the ubs for a second time , " says banking researcher geiger .
the second  |||  catastrophe  |||  followed closely on the heels of the first .
a few months later , ubs capitulated in the tax dispute with the usa and declared that it was prepared to hand over the data of wealthy clients who had potentially avoided paying tax with the  |||  help  |||  of the bank .
ubs also agreed to pay 780 million dollars consisting of repayment of unjustified profits from the  |||  business  |||  and a penalty .
at the same time , ubs  |||  lost  |||  something that had always been its advantage when competing for rich clients - the fog of secrecy .
|||  swiss  |||  banking secrecy was not the same after the scandal .
the bank had lost its credibility in both of its core  |||  business  |||  divisions within a few months - in investment banking thanks to bad speculation and in asset management by aiding and abetting tax evasion .
and just as things had calmed down and ubs looked like it would start to turn things around , along came a disastrous rogue trader . a single trader gambled away 1.7 billion euros before the bank noticed something was  |||  wrong  |||  .
one thing is  |||  clear  |||  - risk management in the investment banking division is still not working .
" the adoboli incident clearly showed that risk control had changed too  |||  little  |||  , " says martin janssen , economic and professor of finance at the swiss banking institute of the university of zurich .
the cfo of one  |||  major  |||  german bank also has no doubts : " the problem facing ubs is that it does not having a handle on risk control . "
it was precisely the concept of caution that had long ago made swiss bankers the guardians of the world 's  |||  major  |||  assets - no excessive risk , but security for money , whether the world fell apart outside the alpine republic or not .
the safes of  |||  swiss  |||  banks had become a symbol of unshakeable reliability , just as lindt and sprüngli had come to symbolise sophisticated chocolate .
the ubs headquarters in zurich still fit the cliché of the dignified  |||  swiss  |||  private bank - just a bit bigger .
the  |||  location  |||  alone is classic .
the bank has its head office on zurich 's bahnhofstrasse that leads from the main station directly to zurich lake , surrounded by the snow - capped peaks of the  |||  swiss  |||  mountains .
the buildings are ostentatious and the shop rates are among the highest in  |||  europe  |||  .
jewellers such as tiffany 's are to be found here between traditional  |||  swiss  |||  shops such as confiserie sprüngli .
the swiss banks have resided here for hundreds of years - from the national bank to the palace of  |||  credit  |||  suisse and elite private banks such as julius bär .
a  |||  heavy  |||  revolving door opens onto the ubs reception .
ubs knows that its clients are looking for -  |||  security  |||  .
he believes ubs has grown too big - particularly in  |||  investment  |||  banking where the anglo - saxons are also very active .
the catastrophe became  |||  evident  |||  on 15 october 2008 .
" that wednesday , the government coalition of a small country with a population of seven million undertook the largest rescue operation in the history of the  |||  nation  |||  , " writes author lukas hässig in his book the ubs crash .
the politicians approved up to 68 billion swiss francs ( around 45 billion euros ) to  |||  save  |||  the bank from bankruptcy .
talking to swiss banks , they see the  |||  issue  |||  mainly in the size of ubs .
two of the  |||  three  |||  major swiss banks consolidated into a single , vast group in june 1998 .
a bank was created that was already too big for small switzerland when the merger was agreed - and a bank that continued to  |||  grow  |||  .
two names are connected with the  |||  rise  |||  of ubs : peter wuffli , group ceo of ubs from 2001 to 2007 , and marcel ospel , chairman of the board of directors .
" i always  |||  thought  |||  that wuffli and ospel were a dream team , " says the banking research , hans geiger .
" wuffli , highly intellectual ,  |||  modest  |||  , with a deep understanding of models and statistics , and ospel , with gut instinct who had worked his way up from being a banker 's apprentice . "
but ospel in the end  |||  relied  |||  on wuffli .
and wuffli ultimately may have made a critical error . " he  |||  thought  |||  his models were reality , " says geiger .
" that is  |||  tragic  |||  . "
|||  tragic  |||  it may be .
pride comes before a  |||  fall  |||  .
the american bank was the world 's most powerful  |||  investment  |||  bank .
it led the " league  |||  tables  |||  " that documented the success of the banks at that time .
commissioned management consultants , however , pointed out a weakness . in terms of what in banking terminology is referred to as "  |||  fixed  |||  income , " ubs was far behind the very largest banks .
to plug the hole , ubs entered on an adventure that almost  |||  cost  |||  it its existence .
hungry for growth , the bank  |||  itself  |||  and a hedge fund founded by the bank invested in us subprime securities .
it  |||  developed  |||  into a vast machine that packaged up securities based on us mortgage credit and passed them on - while itself continuing to bear risks .
even when other  |||  banks  |||  had long been looking for a way out , ubs carried on .
" ubs was buying as late as the summer of 2007 when the us housing market was in flames , " says banking  |||  expert  |||  geiger .
one manager after the next had to go as the attempts to clean up proved more  |||  difficult  |||  than anticipated .
he must find a strategy for a bank that has turned its back on all existing  |||  business  |||  models .
the  |||  bank  |||  , however , is not ( yet ) prepared to go that far .
it is clear , nonetheless , that  |||  investment  |||  banking must shrink significantly .
the new head of the bank , sergio ermotti , plans to  |||  present  |||  his future strategy to the world on tuesday .
the 51 - year - old italo -  |||  swiss  |||  banker was actually only imagined as a transitional solution when the bank parted ways unexpectedly with his predecessor grübel .
ermotti plans to take the investment bank  |||  back  |||  to where it was in the mid - 90s .
he is cutting 3500  |||  jobs  |||  .
but that will not be  |||  enough  |||  .
ubs  |||  needs  |||  a vision .
how does it plan to make  |||  money  |||  ?

|||  fear  |||  of recession in europe depresses us stock exchange
the impending recession in europe has depressed the mood of us  |||  investors  |||  at the start of the week .
the change of government in athens and rome had little  |||  impact  |||  .
curbed industrial  |||  production  |||  on the continent nipped hopes that the debt crisis might stabilise in the bud .
the italian and greek glass was still considered half  |||  full  |||  last week , not half empty - now the problems are coming to the fore once again , said mark luschini of janney montgomery scott .
the dow jones industrial average closed business at 12,078 with a  |||  fall  |||  of 0.6 percent .
the market barometer fluctuated between 12,027 and 12,170  |||  points  |||  in the course of trading .
the broader s&p 500 index closed at 1251  |||  point  |||  , down one percent .
the nasdaq technology index  |||  lost  |||  0.8 percent and closed trading at 2657 points .
industry in the 17 euro countries has significantly  |||  reduced  |||  production and is adjusting to the end of the upturn .
the announcement made us investors sceptical . " we are not an island . we are  |||  dependent  |||  , " said steve goldman of goldman management .
he also claimed that europe is not likely to shake off a recession quickly and that there are further signs of  |||  weakness  |||  in the banks .
the investment legend , warren buffett , could only support such caution . in a cnbc interview , he said that it was not yet clear whether europe is  |||  strong  |||  enough to do all that is needed to end the crisis .
in his opinion , it is therefore too  |||  early  |||  to invest in european government bonds or banks .
instead , buffett threw a  |||  decades  |||  - old principle out of the window to invest in the us technology industry .
his  |||  investment  |||  of more than ten billion dollars in ibm boosted the veteran company 's share price by almost one percent against the trend during the course of trading .
buffett claims to have paid 170 dollars on  |||  average  |||  per share and now has a 5.5 percent stake .
the share price of his  |||  investment  |||  company berkshire hathaway fell 1.3 percent .
the share price went up 1.5 percent after the corporation picked up the biggest  |||  order  |||  in its history .
including options to buy 20 more planes , the total volume is in  |||  fact  |||  26 billion dollars .
around 710 million shares changed hands on the new york stock  |||  exchange  |||  .
719 shares rose , 2281 fell and 79  |||  remained  |||  unchanged .
some like the birds , others would like to get rid of them as fast as possible . crows have been part of the cityscape for hundreds of years , but residents complaining about the filth and noise the animals create are increasing in  |||  number  |||  in many communities .
a solution to the  |||  problem  |||  birds , however , is far from within reach .
looking for  |||  alternatives  |||  in the cities
conservationists stated that migration of specially  |||  protected  |||  rooks was the root of the problem in cities , pointing out that the use of chemicals in agriculture was increasingly destroying traditional habitats .
hunting , increasing development and felling of  |||  typical  |||  breeding trees was making life hard for the birds .
crows are  |||  protected  |||  .
there are  |||  large  |||  colonies with more than 600 breeding pairs in the westphalian town of soest and in the north - west in jever , diepholz , achim bei bremen and leer .
a controversial project to cull crows in leer was behind  |||  negative  |||  headlines in 2005 .
critics described the capture of the birds in bird traps and how they were beaten to death with clubs as  |||  particularly  |||  brutal .
"  |||  normal  |||  displacement and deterrence does nothing , " said town and country planner werner klöver from leer .
spraying off nests with water or felling trees often has undesired consequences , said environment  |||  expert  |||  manfred kaiser from lahr in baden - württemberg .
" the animals disperse and  |||  large  |||  colonies split up and spread to other areas . "
deterrence would only be conceivable as an exception in hospitals ,  |||  retirement  |||  homes and schools .
" we have to  |||  live  |||  with them . getting rid of them is not an option . "
without the surrounding area , the problem in the cities will not be  |||  solved  |||  , said leer 's mayor , wolfgang kellner .
a combination of deterring birds from  |||  sensitive  |||  residential areas and offering incentives for them to move back to other areas would be an option .
jürgens was a co - founder of the ascherberg crow educational trail in schleswig - holstein , where notice boards  |||  provide  |||  information about the life of the highly intelligent rook .
jürgens also expressed her opinion on the criticism of the noise the birds make . " the noise conveys a lot of information . they have a lot to say to  |||  each  |||  other . "
behavioural  |||  researchers  |||  at the university of cambridge recently tested the extent of the birds " intelligence on four rooks .
in a  |||  second  |||  experiment , the canny crows had to solve a trickier problem .
the  |||  researchers  |||  put a small bucket with a moth larva in a vertical cylinder .
three of the four rooks even  |||  managed  |||  it at the first attempt .
ronaldo rockets portugal to  |||  euro  |||  2012
the hopes of bosnians and  |||  turks  |||  for a last minute win were short - lived .
the favourites portugal , croatia and the czech republic , plus  |||  ireland  |||  , will be at the 2012 european championship .
portugal , the czech republic , croatia and ireland have got the  |||  final  |||  spots for the euro 2012 championship in poland and ukraine .
led by superstar cristiano ronaldo who scored in the 8th and 53rd minutes , portugal beat bosnia - herzegovina 6:2 ( 2:1 ) , rounding off their  |||  fifth  |||  euro appearance perfectly after 0:0 in the first leg .
the czechs only needed 1:0 ( 0:0 ) in the playoff second leg against outsider montenegro after a  |||  clear  |||  win in the first leg ( 2:0 ) .
nani ( 24th minute ) , helder postiga ( 72nd and 82nd ) and miguel veloso ( 80th ) scored the other goals for  |||  portugal  |||  .
bosnia had already been knocked out of the world cup 2010 playoffs in  |||  south africa  |||  against portugal .
portugal got off to a perfect  |||  start  |||  in lisbon 's estadio da luz .
ronaldo pounded a  |||  free  |||  kick into the nets from about 30 meters to take an early lead .
the bosnians , with no opening in the first half hour , had their first  |||  opportunity  |||  with goal scorer edin dzeko .
the former wolfsburg player from the english championship leader manchester city put a header onto the bottom edge of the crossbar in the 33rd minute , but the ball did not go over the goal  |||  line  |||  .
jiracek scores for the  |||  czech republic  |||
the referee  |||  wolfgang  |||  stark from ergolding then garnered some attention .
following an attack on helder postiga in the bosnian penalty area in the 36th minute , stark decided the portuguese player had simulated and  |||  gave  |||  him a yellow card .
after half - time , the vice -  |||  european  |||  champions of 2004 settled the score with four more goals .
petr jiracek cleared up any remaining doubt for the czechs in the 81st  |||  minute  |||  .
goalie petr cech prevented a  |||  potential  |||  own goal from tomas sivok in the 9th minute with a split - second reflex .
montenegro had its  |||  best  |||  opportunities when the stevan jovetic and dejan damjanovic duo were on the field .
the winning goal was scored just  |||  before  |||  full - time .
turkey , meanwhile , was lacking  |||  football  |||  genius in zagreb .
four  |||  days  |||  after losing 0:3 in istanbul , the turks could do no better than a 0:0 draw in zagreb .
while it is now virtually a certainty that national trainer guus hiddink must now give up his place on the bench of the team that reached third place in 2002 , the croatians are through to the  |||  final  |||  round of a european championship for the fourth time .
the turks almost managed the perfect start in front of 31,000  |||  spectators  |||  at the maksimir stadium .
selcuk inan 's long - range shot hit the post in the seventh minute and striker kazim kazim was  |||  unable  |||  to put the rebound into the net .
croatia then woke up , taking more and more  |||  control  |||  of the game .
ireland kept up the pace , but had to wait until the 23rd  |||  minute  |||  when robbie keane from los angeles had the first clean shot on goal .
the estonian rearguard prevented him at the last  |||  moment  |||  from taking ireland into the lead .
the tram was forced to break abruptly on herzbergallee when a vehicle  |||  stopped  |||  suddenly in front of it .

mass slaughter on a  |||  personal  |||  level
here is  |||  advice  |||  for proceeding : gently excise this page and make it your bookmark .
mr. englund is a  |||  swedish  |||  historian and journalist .
what he has written here is an unusual  |||  book  |||  , one he describes , not inaccurately , as " a work of anti - history . "
it contains few big names ,  |||  major  |||  treaties or famous battles ; there are almost no ambassadors , dashing journalists or discussions of tactics and materiel .
it 's not so much a book about what  |||  happened  |||  , he explains , as " a book about what it was like . " it 's about " feelings , impressions , experiences and moods . "
a few of these people will  |||  become  |||  heroes .
a few will  |||  become  |||  prisoners of war , or lose limbs , go mad or die .
their  |||  lives  |||  flicker here like votive candles lighted in a church ; new ones are added to the mix while some wink out .
it is a corrective too to the notion that world war i was only about the dire trench warfare on the western  |||  front  |||  .
" the beauty and the sorrow " expertly pans across other theaters of war : the alps , the balkans , the eastern  |||  front  |||  , mesopotamia , east africa .
soldiers in this book have beehives  |||  fall  |||  on them ; one has christmas in egypt under the pyramids ; tsetse flies are an intractable problem .
this is a  |||  moving  |||  book , almost from the start .
war floods these people 's lives like a  |||  natural  |||  catastrophe , a hurricane katrina that reeks of cordite .
almost no one understands what 's  |||  happening  |||  , even why this war is to be fought .
"  |||  lack  |||  of facts , " mr. englund observes , " has been padded out with guesses , suppositions , hopes , fears , idées fixes , conspiracy theories , dreams , nightmares and rumors . "
" the beauty and the sorrow " follows individuals like florence farmborough , an english nurse in the russian army , and richard stumpf , a young  |||  german  |||  high - seas fleet seaman .
their stories are mostly taken from memoirs , letters and other already  |||  published  |||  material .
the accounts of their lives can be terrifying or stirring , but are most fully alive in mr. englund 's accumulation of small moments , stray  |||  details  |||  .
many of these are about  |||  deprivation  |||  and making do .
in telling a german schoolgirl 's story he  |||  says  |||  : " ersatz , everywhere ersatz . "
" substitute coffee , fake aluminum , imitation rubber ,  |||  paper  |||  bandages , wooden buttons . "
he goes on about the ersatz  |||  food  |||  in germany .
he describes " meat made of pressed rice boiled in mutton fat ( and finished off with a fake bone made of wood ) ;  |||  tobacco  |||  made of dried roots and dried potato peel ; shoes soled with wood . "
there are , he notes , " 837  |||  registered  |||  meat substitutes permissible in the production of sausages , 511 registered coffee substitutes . "
some  |||  stories  |||  are about honor and bravery .
conversely a  |||  british  |||  soldier realizes that he will most likely die , and that no one will notice or care .
" once one is resigned to the thought of sacrificing oneself , one would like to think that it might  |||  happen  |||  in front of an audience , " he writes .
he catches the arrival of what he calls " a new species in the bestiary of the young century : the articulate and ideologically convinced  |||  mass  |||  murderer in well - cut clothes who performs his butchery while sitting behind a desk . "
people  |||  behave  |||  in unanticipated ways ; there is as much base behavior as heroism .
mr. englund discussed the soldiers who actively  |||  tried  |||  to catch a venereal disease from prostitutes as a way to evade service at the front .
" the most grotesque expression of this can be seen in the  |||  trade  |||  of gonococcal pus , which soldiers buy and smear into their genitals in the hope of ending up in hospital , " he writes .
in dozens of small scenes he catches the way the war has " unleashed uniquely uncontrollable forces :  |||  extreme  |||  nationalism , social revolution , religious hatred . "
people begin to ask why their  |||  leaders  |||  are making them fight .
the best books about world war i have often been oblique , like paul fussell 's " great war and modern memory , " or novels , like erich maria remarque 's " all quiet on the western  |||  front  |||  , " rather than comprehensive histories .
but it 's as if he has reached from his book , snatched that dramatis personae  |||  page  |||  from your fingers , and lighted it with a match .
after an earlier misstep , a minutely  |||  planned  |||  raid
the overnight hours of monday into tuesday were  |||  chosen  |||  because zuccotti park would be at its emptiest .
the operation was kept secret from all but a few high - ranking officers , with  |||  others  |||  initially being told that they were embarking on an exercise .
police  |||  commissioner  |||  raymond w. kelly was at the center , his presence underscoring how the operation was fraught with challenges for the police department .
there could be no repeat of episodes in recent weeks , like the pepper - spraying of protesters , that violated department rules and created a firestorm of  |||  public  |||  sympathy for the squatters .
and so the police operation to clear zuccotti park of protesters unfolded after two weeks of planning and  |||  training  |||  .
the last  |||  training  |||  session was on monday night , on the manhattan side of the east river .
the orders to  |||  move  |||  into the park came down at the " last minute , " said someone familiar with the orders , which referred to the assignment only as " an exercise . "
" the only people who were  |||  aware  |||  of them going into zuccotti park were at the very highest levels of the department . "
one reason for the secrecy was a lesson learned by the  |||  city  |||  .
mr. kelly said many people , almost like commuters , had been  |||  coming  |||  and going from the park during the day , making 1 a.m. a good time to move in .
emergency service unit trucks with klieg lights and loudspeakers gathered at pike slip and the franklin d. roosevelt  |||  drive  |||  , near the manhattan bridge , before moving out .
as the community affairs officers moved into the park in their light - blue windbreakers , many protesters simply gathered their belongings and  |||  left  |||  .
reporters in the park were  |||  forced  |||  to leave .
paul j. browne , the  |||  police  |||  department 's chief spokesman , said it was for their safety .
but many journalists said that they had been prevented from  |||  seeing  |||  the police take action in the park , and that they had been roughly handled by officers .
mr. browne said television camera trucks on church street , along the park 's western  |||  border  |||  , were able to capture images .
as the police moved west through the dense tangle of protesters " personal belongings , including luggage and plastic lawn and leaf bags stuffed with  |||  clothing  |||  , crews from the sanitation department followed , scooping up what was left behind .
some protesters who refused to  |||  move  |||  were dragged out , the images appearing on the internet soon after .
a core group of protesters took up positions  |||  close  |||  to the encampment 's kitchen area , near the center of the park .
some made a barrier , and the police moved in to methodically  |||  arrest  |||  them .
emergency  |||  service  |||  officers were called in to cut the locks .
no arrests were made in the  |||  park  |||  until about 3:30 a.m. , mr. kelly said .
the clearing operation was  |||  complete  |||  about 75 minutes later , the police said .
most of the arrests were for " disorderly conduct and resisting  |||  arrest  |||  , " he said .
the highest - ranking officer on the scene was joseph j. esposito , the chief of  |||  department  |||  , the top uniformed officer in the department .
phil t. pulaski , the  |||  department  |||  's chief of detectives , was also there .
mr. kelly , while  |||  present  |||  , was " not directing operations , " mr. browne said .
a  |||  second  |||  group of officers waited along the eastern side of broadway , between liberty and cedar streets , in case they had to move in .
barricades were set up at cortlandt street , a  |||  block  |||  north of the park , and at pine street , a block south .
from those  |||  positions  |||  , the police were seen expanding the perimeter even farther outward from zuccotti park .
at one  |||  point  |||  , several officers , many with shields , were seen pushing people farther out .
about 28 people were on the  |||  northern  |||  perimeter .
some of the rowdiest action of the  |||  night  |||  took place south of the park .
around 5 a.m. , south of pine street , one protester jumped on the hood of a police car , and  |||  others  |||  were seen releasing the air from the tires of a police van .
at one  |||  point  |||  , a piece of plywood came flying from the crowd .
the union representing hundreds of school support workers who lost their jobs last month plans to sue the city on wednesday , claiming the layoffs were unnecessary and discriminatory because of their disproportionate impact on schools that serve  |||  poor  |||  students .
the lawsuit is possibly the  |||  last  |||  weapon available to the union , district council 37 , in its effort to reverse the layoffs .
six hundred seventy - two school aides , parent coordinators and other employees who were among the city 's lowest  |||  paid  |||  lost their jobs on oct. 7 , in a move union leaders have described as political payback for their refusal to let the city access a health care fund run by labor groups to close its budget gap last spring .
at a city council hearing  |||  last  |||  month , schools chancellor dennis m. walcott said the layoffs were a part of the budget they signed off on in june .
one council member fired back , telling him that nothing in the budget specified that school support  |||  staff  |||  members would be laid off .
the suit will list mr. walcott and the city 's department of education as defendants , and counts eight laid - off  |||  workers  |||  as plaintiffs , all of them black or latino women , as were most of the aides who lost their jobs .
elizabeth thomas , a spokeswoman for the  |||  city  |||  's law department , said the city had not seen the lawsuit and therefore could not comment on its specific allegations .
according to a draft of the complaint obtained by the new york times , the union has zeroed in on the number of layoffs at schools in poor parts of the city to support a claim of inequitable treatment , saying poor schools  |||  lost  |||  more aides because they had been chronically underfinanced .
it points out that while there were no layoffs on staten island and few layoffs in schools in the upper east side or tribeca , 17  |||  school  |||  aides lost their jobs in district 23 in brownsville , brooklyn , and 46 were let go in districts 8 and 9 in the south bronx .
p.s. 36 " s budget was cut by 3.26 percent this year , and it also  |||  lost  |||  money when the city changed the way it calculates the extra financing for each poor student schools enroll .
the union also  |||  claims  |||  that high school principals may have been misled by the language in a memo authorizing the dismissal of parent coordinators .
the memo used the word " excess " to describe the action , even though " excess " more commonly describes the act of  |||  moving  |||  a teacher from a school 's payroll into a pool of available workers whose salaries are paid by the central office .
mission over , congress ready to  |||  agree  |||  on libya
it finally looks like republicans and democrats on capitol hill are ready to  |||  agree  |||  on something related to the uprising in libya .
all it took was for the revolt to succeed , longtime dictator moammar gaddafi to be captured and  |||  killed  |||  and american involvement to end .
on tuesday , the senate foreign relations committee is to consider a resolution , sponsored by chairman john kerry ( d - mass. ) , along with sens . john mccain ( r - ariz. ) and joseph i. lieberman ( i - conn. ) , applauding libyans for their  |||  successful  |||  rebellion and u.s. troops for their " bravery . "
" this resolution is about honoring the courageous people of libya as they  |||  begin  |||  to rebuild their country , " kerry said .
this summer , lawmakers from both parties squabbled with each other and the white house over the wording of a series of resolutions to approve or disapprove of the u.s.  |||  military  |||  's role in the nato mission in libya .
in june , kerry and mccain introduced a resolution authorizing the  |||  limited  |||  use of u.s. military forces in libya .
the bill was defeated in the  |||  house  |||  by a wide bipartisan margin , and it never came up for a vote in the senate .
but on the same day that bill failed in the house , the chamber also voted down a measure that would have cut funding for  |||  american  |||  operations in libya .
then  |||  congress  |||  's indecision was overtaken by events .
tripoli fell to libyan rebels in august , and gaddafi was  |||  killed  |||  oct. 20 .
the nato mission officially  |||  ended  |||  oct. 31 .
now the  |||  senate  |||  may be ready to act .
the foreign relations committee resolution " congratulates the people of libya for their tremendous courage and extraordinary resilience in liberating themselves " and " commends the men and women of the united states armed forces and their coalition partners who engaged in military operations to protect the people of libya for their  |||  extraordinary  |||  bravery and professionalism . "
the resolution also " affirms the  |||  national  |||  interest of the united states in a successful and irreversible transition to democracy in libya . "
will the new measure earn the  |||  full  |||  support of the foreign relations panel , or will it split lawmakers like the june bill did ?
the last version was opposed by sen. richard g. lugar ( ind . ) , the committee 's top  |||  republican  |||  .
lugar 's spokesman said monday that he had not  |||  seen  |||  the final version of the new bill yet .
across the capitol , the house is to vote this week on a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget , a top legislative priority of nearly  |||  every  |||  congressional republican and some democrats .
other lawmakers have been unsuccessful so far in bringing their  |||  amendments  |||  to the floor , but not for lack of trying .
goodlatte 's is just one of 68 constitutional amendments that have been introduced this congress , spanning a  |||  wide  |||  range of topics .
some are duplicates - the same bill offered in both the house and senate - and  |||  others  |||  are slight variations on each other .
there are at least 15 versions of the balanced budget  |||  amendment  |||  in the house alone , and another handful that would " control federal spending . "
the budget control act , which passed in august ,  |||  required  |||  that both the house and senate vote on a balanced budget amendment .
in march , 58 senators voted in favor of a non - binding resolution  |||  supporting  |||  the idea of such an amendment .
|||  beyond  |||  the budget , several members want to limit the number of terms members of congress can serve , while rep. josé e. serrano ( d - n.y. ) wants to lift the two - term limit for presidents .
rep. jesse l. jackson jr. ( d - ill. ) has  |||  offered  |||  a host of amendments guaranteeing the right to quality education and health care , among other subjects .
some lawmakers also want to  |||  allow  |||  for the nullification of federal laws if they are opposed by two - thirds of the states .
as eager as  |||  members  |||  have been to offer amendments , they 're not moving at any faster pace than in past years .
in the 111th congress , lawmakers  |||  offered  |||  77 such amendments , and they introduced 66 in the 110th .
but they were n't much more  |||  successful  |||  then than they are now .
the last  |||  amendment  |||  to be added - the 27th - was ratified in 1992 , but it was actually proposed by congress in 1789 .
ten months after a gunman shot her at point - blank range at a constituent event in tucson , rep. gabrielle gifffords ( d - ariz. ) appeared on national television monday night , sang along to the broadway  |||  show  |||  tune " the sun will come out tomorrow " and said she wanted to get better more than she wanted to return to congress .
appearing on abc news 's " 20/20 " with diane sawyer , giffords struggled to formed sentences and  |||  needed  |||  help walking .
the show documented her difficult journey back from the damage inflicted by a bullet that fractured her skull and pierced the  |||  left  |||  side of her brain , passing from the front to the back of her head .
three months ago , she made a surprise return to the  |||  house  |||  to triumphantly cast her vote on the debt - ceiling deal .
in her first television interview since the january shooting that killed six and wounded 13 , giffords smiled , laughed and sang - and described her recovery as "  |||  difficult  |||  . "
asked by sawyer how she feels , giffords , 41 ,  |||  responded  |||  , " pretty good . "
the interview with giffords and her husband , astronaut mark kelly , was  |||  part  |||  of an hour - long " 20/20 " special that aired on the eve of the release of the couple 's new book , " gabby : a story of courage and hope . "
in videos shot by kelly in the first few weeks , she is  |||  seen  |||  in her hospital bed , her head shaved and a long scar across her forehead .
she is capable only of holding up one or two fingers as her husband  |||  encourages  |||  her .
months later , giffords is seen sitting up in a wheelchair as therapists teach her how to perform simple  |||  actions  |||  .
and then , her first  |||  word  |||  : " what . "
within days , giffords uttered  |||  another  |||  word - " toast , " a request for a change in her breakfast menu .
videos aired by abc show that music played a central role in giffords 's recovery : the congresswoman is seen singing along with therapists to cyndi lauper 's " girls just wanna have fun " and tom petty 's "  |||  free  |||  fallin . " "
her husband said that he was reading giffords a  |||  newspaper  |||  story about the shooting on march 12 when she stopped him to ask for the first time about the six who had been killed in the incident .
" a lot of people died , " giffords  |||  told  |||  sawyer .
at one point in his  |||  wife  |||  's recovery , kelly told sawyer , she said , " i 've been beaten . "
and you 're going to get through this , and you 're going to recover and you 're going to come back stronger than  |||  ever  |||  .
troops feel more pity than  |||  respect  |||
kid rock sang a ballad about helplessness , frustration and  |||  loss  |||  .
on cue , several hundred  |||  soldiers  |||  , sailors , airmen and marines strode into position around him .
a senior military officer at the gala , also attended by the joint chiefs then - chairman , adm . mike mullen , saw the  |||  troops  |||  " role differently .
i 'm  |||  sure  |||  the organizers meant well .
but it was n't  |||  respect  |||  , really . it was pity .
the starkly conflicting impressions illustrate the uneasy relationship that has taken hold between the military and an often distant , sometimes adoring  |||  american  |||  public .
the public increasingly  |||  acts  |||  as if it feels sorry for those in uniform .
" we are n't victims at all , " said brig. gen. sean b. macfarland , who commanded troops in iraq and will soon  |||  leave  |||  for afghanistan .
" but it seems that the only way that some can be  |||  supportive  |||  is to cast us in the role of hapless souls . "
the topic is a sensitive one for military leaders , who do not want to  |||  appear  |||  ungrateful or at odds with the public they serve .
as a  |||  result  |||  , most of the conversations about pity take place quietly and privately among combat veterans .
after his two sons returned from combat tours with the marines , retired col . mark cancian warned them that people outside the military would  |||  view  |||  their service from two perspectives .
|||  others  |||  would wonder whether there was an " angry , violent veteran beneath the surface , " said cancian , who fought in iraq and returned to a senior government job in washington .
during his job search , he said , he sensed that some interviewers had subtly inquired whether he would be able to hold up under the strain of a demanding washington job immediately after his  |||  combat  |||  tour .
the military 's unease springs , in part , from  |||  american  |||  indifference to the wars .
battlefield achievements are rarely singled out for praise by a country that has little familiarity with the military and sees little direct  |||  benefit  |||  from the iraq and afghanistan wars .
" we , as a  |||  nation  |||  , no longer value military heroism in ways that were entirely common in world war ii , " said retired lt. gen. david barno , who commanded u.s. troops in afghanistan .
instead ,  |||  praise  |||  from politicians and the public focuses largely on the depth of a service member 's suffering .
|||  troops  |||  are recognized for the number of tours they have endured , the number of friends they have lost or the extent of their injuries .
|||  military  |||  faces mounting pressure to crack down on rape
this week , a landmark hearing will decide whether 28 women and men have a case against the  |||  military  |||  for alleged inaction on rape .
if not ,  |||  hundreds  |||  of plaintiffs are lining up for the next one .
pfc . elizabeth lyman was 25 years old and 11 weeks pregnant the night she says she was raped by a  |||  fellow  |||  soldier .
it was october 2008 , and she was heading back to her barracks at miramar air station , just north of san diego , after dinner with a friend when she ran into a  |||  male  |||  colleague carrying a 12 - pack of beer .
" he 's from  |||  texas  |||  , " she says .
" i wish i had  |||  listened  |||  to my instincts . "
filed in february by susan burke , a washington , d.c. , attorney , the suit initially involved 17 plaintiffs but grew to 28 in the following months - 25 women and three men , all of whom allege that they were raped or sexually assaulted by fellow soldiers , and that the military  |||  failed  |||  to investigate , prosecute , or provide adequate justice after the alleged attacks .
" who are the individuals who are in the  |||  position  |||  to eradicate the culture of retaliation ? the top leadership . "
burke also says that since february , she has been contacted by nearly 400 other survivors , many of  |||  whom  |||  could be part of future suits .
the defense team for the department of defense , led by  |||  united  |||  states attorney neil macbride , has filed a motion to dismiss the case .
the court papers , obtained by newsweek , detail the defense strategy - essentially , that the military cannot be sued by  |||  current  |||  or former soldiers for injuries incurred in the armed forces .
" the alleged harms are incident to plaintiffs "  |||  military  |||  service , " the documents say .
while women are still officially prohibited from serving in combat , that distinction is in name only : modern wars rarely have  |||  clear  |||  front lines .
the result : between those two wars , 150 female soldiers have died - two thirds of them during  |||  combat  |||  situations .
it 's time for the  |||  military  |||  to modernize as well , burke says .
she is n't alone in her  |||  fight  |||  ; three other lawsuits are under way in addition to hers .
at yale law  |||  school  |||  , the veterans " legal services clinic is preparing a case against the four major military academies for allegedly fostering a misogynistic atmosphere .
separately , the nonprofit vietnam veterans of america is assembling a suit against the military that focuses on the " personality disorder " diagnoses assigned to rape victims in order to discharge them from service - a common occurrence , according to activists such as anu bhagwati of the service women 's  |||  action  |||  network , a human - rights group .
her group filed a suit in december against the veterans administration , charging it with discriminatory  |||  practices  |||  in the way it handles benefit claims for people who say they were sexually assaulted in the service .
nine  |||  separate  |||  bills have been introduced in congress by a bipartisan mix of senators and representatives , proposing a range of fixes .
in 2010 there were 3,158 sexual assaults reported , according to the department of  |||  defense  |||  's sexual assault prevention and response office .
but assaults are notoriously underreported , and by the pentagon 's own estimate , that figure accounts for approximately 13.5 percent of the  |||  estimated  |||  19,000 incidents that occurred that year .
the plaintiffs in burke 's case  |||  describe  |||  their attacks as just the first of a series of traumas .
she did a rape kit , and her assailant 's  |||  blood  |||  - from a cut on his arm - was found in her bed .
six months later , in april 2009 , lyman sat through a hearing  |||  before  |||  a judge , during which she was questioned about having had sex with her boyfriend earlier on the day of the attack .
six people testified as character witnesses on behalf of the  |||  alleged  |||  perpetrator , who was eventually acquitted .
" i remember the day when the verdict was read , " lyman  |||  says  |||  .
" they put me into the psychiatric unit , and when i got out , i  |||  remember  |||  saying to my command officer , " that was n't his trial . that was my trial . " "
lyman was ordered to visit a  |||  military  |||  psychiatrist , who eventually diagnosed her with a personality disorder , rendering her unfit for service .
what  |||  stands  |||  between them and a verdict is this doctrine that has been criticized since it was first issued .
i 've been a lifelong  |||  critic  |||  of the feres doctrine .
he adds , " the odds are heavily against them ... but it 's  |||  important  |||  for them to try . "
these things only  |||  change  |||  when good people are willing to fight .
if the hearing does n't go their way , burke , the plaintiffs "  |||  lawyer  |||  , will cue up her hundreds of other plaintiffs for future cases .
" we will continue battling the  |||  military  |||  on this issue until reform occurs , " she says .
walls have eyes : how  |||  researchers  |||  are studying you on facebook
before he became the new face of right - wing extremism in europe , anders behring breivik was just  |||  another  |||  guy airing his anti - immigration views online .
on monday , breivik , who  |||  admitted  |||  to a killing spree in norway in july which left 77 people dead , faced his first public court hearing .
while breivik may have acted alone , he was far from alone in cyberspace : he had  |||  spent  |||  much of the time leading up to his attack at his computer , chatting with some of the millions of nationalists who support right - wing groups on social - networking sites .
after this summer 's tragedy ,  |||  researchers  |||  wanted to find out more about these people .
|||  easy  |||  - just log on to facebook .
" we realized that it was n't that  |||  difficult  |||  to get to them at all , " says jamie bartlett , the lead author of a recently published report on european digital populism by british think tank demos .
some of the results are n't all that surprising : online  |||  supporters  |||  of right - wing groups tend to be young , male , and vexed by immigration .
demos 's work is just one example of how facebook is  |||  becoming  |||  a hot new tool in the hands of scientists .
think tanks , medical researchers and political scientists are  |||  using  |||  the site to study everything from health issues to social trends as expressed in ' likes ' , wall posts and status updates .
with over 800 million active users adding an  |||  average  |||  of three pieces of content per day , the facebook " data supernova " is generating a research boom , driving the number of academic papers with the site 's name in the title up almost 800 % over the past five years .
for some  |||  researchers  |||  , the beauty of facebook is that it lets you study people you could n't approach with a clipboard on the street .
" before , when you tried to survey people from the british national party , it would be very difficult to  |||  identify  |||  them . "
"  |||  facebook  |||  cuts all that out - you go to them directly . "
others say the site could  |||  offer  |||  a way to identify and tackle social - health problems .
" you ca n't treat a problem if you ca n't diagnose it , " dimitri christakis , moreno 's co - author and director of the center for child health , behavior and development at the seattle children 's research institute ,  |||  told  |||  the washington post .
" we 've found a way to  |||  identify  |||  kids at risk who would not otherwise be diagnosed . "
the site 's data team has worked up stats on relationship status and valentine 's day , voter turnout in the 2010 midterms , and a national happiness index ( mainly  |||  using  |||  information only it can access - champions of digital freedom have long held that the site should make its vast trove of data available to others for research . )
but facebook 's users know the site is watching them , whether they like it or not - the trade off for being able to play scrabble with a friend thousands of miles  |||  away  |||  is allowing the site to mine your personal information .
but what about when facebook  |||  users  |||  become part of a survey they do n't even know about ?
" i do n't think a lot of users had even thought about the fact that a researcher could be looking at their profiles , " says neil selwyn , a sociologist at the london knowledge lab , of a 2006 study he conducted  |||  using  |||  students ' public facebook walls .
then there 's the question of  |||  methodology  |||  .
even offline , there 's no  |||  guarantee  |||  that a research subject is being completely honest .
on facebook , it 's impossible to know how much of a user 's profile information and wall posts are  |||  true  |||  .
"  |||  social  |||  research is supposed to be about the social - and a hell of a lot of the social still takes place offline . "
anders behring breivik , the man who confessed to masterminding twin attacks that  |||  killed  |||  77 people in norway this summer , has described himself as a " resistance " fighter during his first public court appearance in oslo .
" i am a  |||  military  |||  commander in the norwegian resistance movement and knights templar norway , " he said before a courtroom packed with 500 people .
" i object to the court because you received your mandate from organizations that  |||  support  |||  hate ideology and because it supports multiculturalism . "
" i acknowledge the  |||  acts  |||  but i do not plead guilty . "
|||  judge  |||  torkjel nesheim interrupted breivik during that monologue because he " did not want to give breivik the opportunity to use this hearing as a platform for him to express his views . "
for the same reason he refused to allow breivik , who brought a pre - written speech with him , to  |||  address  |||  the relatives of his victims at the end of the hearing .
|||  around  |||  30 survivors and victims " relatives attended the hearing .
some came hoping to  |||  look  |||  breivik in the eye , others to confirm that he is being held under lock and key .
all attended with the goal of  |||  moving  |||  toward closure .
" i thought he seemed cold and inhuman , " one utoya survivor  |||  told  |||  norwegian broadcaster nrk .
" it was uncomfortable , but for me i  |||  moved  |||  on a little bit after seeing and hearing the suspect . "
dressed in a dark suit and blue tie , breivik remained calm and professional throughout the hearing and looked journalists and survivors in the eye as he entered and exited the  |||  building  |||  .
despite breivik 's bizarre notion of being  |||  part  |||  of a larger " resistance " movement , the judge determined that he is not insane , and said that there is no evidence he acted with accomplices .
but that does n't automatically ease the grief and confusion that an entire  |||  nation  |||  still feels .
" it would be so much  |||  easier  |||  if he did . "
7 lessons from the  |||  lost  |||  steve jobs interview , showing at a theater this week
following the death of steve jobs on oct. 5 , there were some who compared him to henry ford - singling out the tech genius as the great  |||  modern  |||  inventor .
he was certainly a designer , dreamer and self - identified hippie , but he was also a meticulous organizer and flow - chart tweaker - a man who believed that many  |||  business  |||  executives suffered from " a disease of thinking that a really great idea is 90 percent of the work ... [ but ] there 's a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product . "
back in 1995 , bob cringely was developing the tv series triumph of the nerds about the dawn of the personal  |||  computer  |||  , and he sat down for more than an hour with jobs for a rare , extended conversation .
at that point in time it had been roughly 10 years since jobs had been  |||  forced  |||  out of apple , and he was already hard at work at his new computer company next , looking forward to the popular adoption of the internet .
this footage , slightly re - edited , is the basis of the 68 - minute steve jobs : the  |||  lost  |||  interview , coming to landmark theaters this wednesday and thursday .
for someone known to loathe in - depth interviews , jobs seems surprisingly eager here to expound on his technological philosophies and  |||  business  |||  strategies .
filmed before the era of pixar , the ipod or the iphone , there 's something eerily prescient about the lost interview , as jobs assesses what he sees other companies doing right and  |||  wrong  |||  , and offers his own vision of the future of computing .
it 's one thing to read posthumous appraisals of jobs "  |||  career  |||  , but there 's something raw and inspiring about the jobs we see here , the anxious dreamer on the brink of greatness .
he has a vision for the way  |||  things  |||  could be and should be .
not  |||  long  |||  after spelling it all out here he went and did it .
a quick rundown of seven notable  |||  lost  |||  interview sequences :
on how he learned to run a  |||  business  |||  :
" throughout the years in  |||  business  |||  , i 'd always ask : " why do you do things ? " and the answers you invariably get are : " oh , that 's just the way it 's done . " "
nobody knows why they do what they do , nobody thinks about things very deeply in  |||  business  |||  .
baffled by the way costs were recorded - often beginning with a " standard cost " that amounted to a blind guess , which was then adjusted with a " variance " - he  |||  developed  |||  an automated factory that ensured they could determine business costs down to the second .
on pranking the  |||  pope  |||  :
the device has been widely written about before , but jobs " euphoria here in describing the  |||  blue  |||  box as an act of empowerment is infectious .
he describes how he and wozniak would test the box by  |||  using  |||  a pay phone , placing a call , and then connecting from one at&t network to another while looping in as many satellites as possible .
" we were wrapping things  |||  around  |||  the globe a half dozen times and you would yell through the pay phone and it would come through a minute later in the pay phone next door , " jobs says with a giggle .
jobs goes on to detail one glorious prank that he and wozniak nearly pulled of , ringing the vatican via the blue box in the middle of the night and requesting to  |||  speak  |||  to the pope , while doing their very best impression of henry kissinger .
not long after their 20 - minute phone conversation ,  |||  jobs  |||  landed a part - time summer job at hewlett - packard .
" that made a remarkable influence on me , it was the only company i had seen at that age and it formed my  |||  view  |||  of what a company was and how well they treated their employees . "
jobs later became one of the hp employees to visit the company 's palo alto research labs , where he saw " the first desktop computer  |||  ever  |||  made . "
i would get a ride up to hp as a teenager and hang  |||  around  |||  that machine and write programs for it .
on improvising  |||  innovation  |||  :
at several  |||  points  |||  in the interview , jobs talks about inventing new products on the fly .
working on only 30 days of credit , he had to figure out both the assembly and delivery of the  |||  finished  |||  devices .
long before he led the revival of apple , jobs presciently foresaw the ways in which so many industry  |||  leaders  |||  would stumble in their vision , and lose control of their market share .
" say you work at ibm or xerox , so you make a better copier or  |||  printer  |||  , so what ? "
the product genius that led to that monopolistic position is rotted out by people who have no conception of good products vs. bad products - the craftsmanship  |||  required  |||  .
that 's what  |||  happened  |||  at xerox ...
xerox could have owned the entire  |||  computer  |||  industry .
on innovation as art  |||  form  |||  :
" there 's a tremendous amount of craftsmanship between a great idea and a great product ... as you evolve that great  |||  idea  |||  , it changes and grows . "
there are tradeoffs you have to make -  |||  certain  |||  things you ca n't make electrons do , glass do , robots do , factories do .
we 've  |||  always  |||  been shameless about stealing great ideas .
it 's part of what made the macintosh great , was that the people who were  |||  working  |||  on it were musicians , poets , artists , zoologists , historians who just happened to be the best computer scientists in the world .
the day the supreme court gathered behind closed doors to consider the politically divisive question of whether it would hear a challenge to president obama 's healthcare law , two of its justices , antonin scalia and clarence thomas , were feted at a dinner sponsored by the law  |||  firm  |||  that will argue the case before the high court .
the occasion was  |||  last  |||  thursday , when all nine justices met for a conference to pour over the petitions for review .
the justices  |||  agreed  |||  to hear the suit ; indeed , a landmark 5 1/2 - hour argument is expected in march , and the outcome is likely to further roil the 2012 presidential race , which will be in full swing by the time the court 's decision is released .
the lawyer who will stand before the court and argue that the law should be thrown out is likely to be paul clement , who served as u.s. solicitor  |||  general  |||  during the george w. bush administration .
clement 's law firm , bancroft pllc , was one of almost two dozen firms that  |||  helped  |||  sponsor the annual dinner of the federalist society , a longstanding group dedicated to advocating conservative legal principles .
another firm that sponsored the dinner , jones day , represents one of the trade associations that challenged the law , the national federation of independent  |||  business  |||  .
another sponsor was pharmaceutical giant pfizer inc , which has an  |||  enormous  |||  financial stake in the outcome of the litigation .
the dinner was held at a washington hotel hours after the  |||  court  |||  's conference over the case .
in attendance was , among  |||  others  |||  , mitch mcconnell , the senate 's top republican and an avowed opponent of the healthcare law .
the featured  |||  guests  |||  at the dinner ? scalia and thomas .
it 's nothing new : the two justices have been attending federalist society  |||  events  |||  for years .
and it 's nothing that  |||  runs  |||  afoul of ethics rules .
in fact , justices are exempt from the code of conduct that governs the actions of  |||  lower  |||  federal justices .
if they were , they arguably fell under code 's canon 4c , which states , " a judge may attend fund - raising events of law -  |||  related  |||  and other organizations although the judge may not be a speaker , a guest of honor , or featured on the program of such an event . "
nevertheless , the sheer proximity of scalia and thomas to two of the law firms in the case , as well as to a company with a  |||  massive  |||  financial interest , was enough to alarm ethics - in - government activists .
" this stunning breach of ethics and indifference to the code belies claims by several justices that the court abides by the same rules that apply to all other federal judges , " said bob edgar , the president of common  |||  cause  |||  .
" the justices were wining and dining at a black - tie fundraiser with attorneys who have pending cases before the  |||  court  |||  . "
their appearance and assistance in fundraising for this event undercuts any  |||  claims  |||  of impartiality , and is unacceptable .
scalia and thomas have  |||  shown  |||  little regard for critics who say they too readily mix the business of the court with agenda - driven groups such as the federalist society .
and thomas " wife , ginni , is a high - profile  |||  conservative  |||  activist .
moreover , conservatives argue that it 's justice elena kagan who has an ethical  |||  issue  |||  , not scalia and thomas .
kagan served as solicitor  |||  general  |||  in the obama administration when the first legal challenges to the law were brought at the trial court level .
her critics have pushed for kagan to recuse herself from hearing the case ,  |||  saying  |||  that she was too invested in defending the law then to be impartial now .
boeing gets  |||  record  |||  $ 18 - billion jetliner order
but it 's a big deal when the company is airplane - maker boeing co. and the list price for those 50 airplanes totals a  |||  record  |||  $ 18 billion .
just as big is where boeing got the order : the middle east , a  |||  growing  |||  gold mine of future airplane orders .
in a forecast released monday , the chicago company estimates that airlines in the middle east over the next 20 years will need 2,520 airplanes  |||  worth  |||  $ 450 billion .
boeing over the weekend announced its biggest - ever  |||  order  |||  by dollar value for commercial airplanes - 50 twin - aisle boeing 777 jets .
the airline also has an option to buy 20 more planes , which would push the  |||  total  |||  list price to $ 26 billion , boeing announced at the 2011 dubai air show .
list  |||  price  |||  for six of those is more than $ 1 billion .
" the quality of these  |||  particular  |||  customers is pretty strong . "
many  |||  middle  |||  east airlines are owned by their oil - producing nations .
boeing co shares  |||  rose  |||  1.5 % to $ 67.94 .
luisa maria calderon alleges that drug traffickers  |||  helped  |||  opponent fausto vallejo of the pri in the governor 's race .
president felipe calderon 's sister  |||  appears  |||  to have lost her bid for governor of michoacan during violent state elections , and she alleged monday that drug traffickers helped tip the race in favor of one of her opponents .
preliminary results gave the  |||  lead  |||  in the race for governor of the western state to fausto vallejo of the institutional revolutionary party , or pri .
" the intervention by organized crime during the entire election process and especially yesterday is alarming , not just for michoacan but for the entire country , " luisa maria calderon said in a  |||  radio  |||  interview a day after sunday 's vote .
but it is staging a comeback , and victory in michoacan is an important  |||  step  |||  in that effort .
the pri is hoping to win the presidential  |||  election  |||  in july .
calderon , a candidate for her brother 's conservative national  |||  action  |||  party , or pan , refused to recognize vallejo as the winner .
silvano aureoles , the candidate for the leftist democratic revolution party , or prd , which  |||  currently  |||  holds the governorship , came in third , a bad defeat for the divided and hapless left ahead of the 2012 presidential vote .
aureoles also  |||  refused  |||  to recognize the preliminary results .
yet  |||  violence  |||  has persisted .
a pan mayor was assassinated a week before the election as he campaigned for luisa maria calderon , and  |||  numerous  |||  candidates quit local races out of fear .
for the pri , though , however nasty the michoacan  |||  election  |||  looks , a win will help the party 's momentum .
the man expected to represent the pri in the presidential race , enrique pena nieto , speaking from washington , congratulated vallejo and said , " i think this victory should be very  |||  encouraging  |||  , looking ahead to next year . "
adb urges asia to help  |||  rescue  |||  eurozone
rajat nag , the managing director of the manila -  |||  based  |||  adb , said the world 's two fastest - growing large economies had to " do all they can " to speed the recovery of the the currency bloc either through the international monetary fund or direct bilateral arrangements .
" we are all in this  |||  together  |||  . "
" so anybody who can help europe get out of the crisis is useful , " he told the financial times in an interview on the sidelines of the world  |||  economic  |||  forum in mumbai .
" asia may be shielded to some  |||  extent  |||  but it cannot be immune . "
" so if china and india can  |||  help  |||  , by all means . "
europe 's  |||  monetary  |||  union has been badly undermined by a sovereign debt crisis in past months .
in  |||  recent  |||  days , italy 's borrowing costs have soared dangerously and the prime ministers of both italy and greece have resigned .
the unfolding sovereign debt crisis in europe has  |||  raised  |||  fears that it could push the global economy back into recession and prompted calls for leading emerging economies to band together to help the eurozone find a solution .
" nobody wants the eurozone to  |||  remain  |||  unstable and turbulent , " he said .
" we have monumental challenges and we have to  |||  sustain  |||  a high level of growth . "
" it is not an  |||  option  |||  , it is an imperative , because where do we find employment for tens of millions of our young men and women . "
others argue that developing economies like india have no business helping wealthy europeans when they  |||  face  |||  their own profound economic challenges .
ashutosh varshney , a professor at brown university in the us , said it would be politically very  |||  difficult  |||  to sell assistance to europe to india 's 1. 2bn people , of whom as many as 800m live on about $ 2 a day or less .
" sometime they will find out that greeks retire at the age of 50 and go on  |||  holiday  |||  to beaches and it wo n't go down well , " he said .
lee howell , the managing director of the world economic forum , likewise questioned why india 's reserves should be used to keep greece 's numerous and well -  |||  paid  |||  public sector workers in jobs in poorly managed , loss - making utilities like the railways .
the adb 's forecast of 7.5 per cent  |||  economic  |||  growth in asia for 2011/12 now faced " risks on the downside " because of the threat from europe .
he said vulnerable emerging markets needed to make " contingency plans " to protect themselves from a downturn and  |||  significant  |||  capital outflows from their economies .
dire warnings from pentagon over  |||  potential  |||  defense cuts
the pentagon already is digesting $ 450 billion of reductions over the  |||  next  |||  decade but now fears an additional $ 600 billion or more in cuts may be imminent if congress cannot reach a deal on spending .
" the impacts of these cuts would be  |||  devastating  |||  for the department , " panetta said in a letter to sens . john mccain , r - arizona , and lindsey graham , r - south carolina .
he said that congressional failure to reach a budget agreement and the  |||  resulting  |||  so - called sequestration would trigger 23 % across - the - board reductions and a halt to many new projects .
" we would also be forced to separate many of our civilian personnel involuntarily and , because the reduction would be imposed so quickly , we would almost certainly have to furlough civilians in order to  |||  meet  |||  the target . "
the cuts would eventually hit  |||  combat  |||  troops , panetta said .
" while wartime funding in the overseas contingency operations accounts is not directly affected by the sequester , war efforts would be adversely affected by the  |||  severe  |||  disruption in the base budgets , " panetta warned .
the two senators had written panetta 10 days ago , asking for details of the  |||  potential  |||  impact of the automatic cuts on the defense department .
" the consequence of a sequester on the defense department would set off a swift decline of the united states as the world 's leading military  |||  power  |||  . "
" we are staunchly opposed to this draconian  |||  action  |||  , " the senators said in a joint statement monday afternoon when they released panetta 's letter .
" the sequester is a threat to the national security interests of the united states , and it should not be  |||  allowed  |||  to occur . "
whether the panetta letter and the fresh warnings from senators will  |||  increase  |||  pressure for a budget compromise or step up calls to exempt the pentagon from cuts remains to be seen .
at a news conference last week , the secretary of defense painted a bleak picture of what could lie ahead -- a military with a shell but no  |||  core  |||  .
" it 's a  |||  ship  |||  without sailors . "
" it 's a paper tiger , an army of barracks , buildings and bombs without  |||  enough  |||  trained soldiers able to accomplish the mission , " panetta said in his opening remarks at the pentagon .
" in  |||  effect  |||  , it invites aggression .. "
in an addendum to his letters to mccain and graham , panetta spelled out new specifics of how reductions " generate  |||  significant  |||  operational risks : delay response time to crises , conflicts , and disasters ; severely limits our ability to be forward deployed and engaged around the world ; and assumes unacceptable risk in future combat operations . "
and panetta said that some of the biggest defense projects could face the ax , including those already being tested and some just in  |||  early  |||  stages of planning .
that list included the f 35 joint strike fighter , a  |||  planned  |||  new bomber , the next - generation ballistic submarine , the new littoral combat ship and the new ground combat vehicle the army and marines need to replace the humvee .
a glance at recent headlines indicates just how  |||  serious  |||  and pervasive deceit and lying are in daily life .
republican presidential  |||  candidate  |||  herman cain is busy trading allegations of sexual harassment with several women ; each side accuses the other of lying .
administrators at penn  |||  state  |||  have been charged with perjury for allegedly covering up reports that a retired football coach was sexually assaulting boys .
last week french president nicolas sarkozy was caught on an open microphone asserting to u.s. president barack obama that israeli  |||  prime minister  |||  benjamin netanyahu is a liar .
new york congressman and internet flasher anthony weiner made a fool of himself issuing denials quickly contradicted by incontrovertible  |||  evidence  |||  .
and then again , no one who lived through it will ever forget the  |||  media  |||  circus president bill clinton unleashed by lying during his second term in office about his sexual involvement with monica lewinsky .
how much deceit do we  |||  encounter  |||  ?
another study showed that strangers lied three times within the first 10 minutes of  |||  meeting  |||  each other .
detecting lies , or " lie spotting , " is an  |||  essential  |||  skill for everyone to acquire , for both personal and professional reasons .
far from being a parlor game similar to , say , charades , where the object is to exclaim , " gotcha , " deception detection is a  |||  serious  |||  branch of knowledge based on scientific data collected over the last six decades at prestigious universities conducting in - depth research projects , especially in psychology and physiology .
one result of the  |||  research  |||  is that most old myths about lying have been debunked .
do n't conclude from this that liars are hard to spot and  |||  difficult  |||  to unmask .
i  |||  spent  |||  several years surveying the scientific findings in the vast and ever emerging body of knowledge on deception , and it is clear that deception detection is a modern skill that is easy to learn and helpful in navigating our complex world -- especially if your professional responsibilities include hiring , interviewing , negotiating or managing .
good liars are skilled at reading  |||  others  |||  well , putting them at ease , managing their own emotions and intuitively sensing how others perceive them .
we know from research that extroverts lie more than introverts , that men tell more " self - oriented " lies while women tell more " other - oriented " lies -- usually to  |||  protect  |||  someone 's feelings -- that married people lie less frequently to their partners than unmarried people do ( but the lies they do tell tend to be " whoppers " ) .
we also know that if you are perceived as a wrongdoer , others will  |||  feel  |||  less guilt in lying to you .
first , observe your  |||  subject  |||  's normal behavior .
observe your  |||  subject  |||  's posture , laugh , vocal quality .
you 'd better know if someone normally taps their foot all the time so you do n't make unjust accusations when you see foot - tapping in the middle of the  |||  meeting  |||  .
consider these clusters red flags , not  |||  proof  |||  of deception .
deceptive people might freeze their upper body when trying to remember their story , they might point their feet toward the door , lean toward an exit , shift their posture in  |||  significant  |||  ways or exhibit " post - interview relief " -- that exaggerated exhale of relief and shift in posture when all the hard questions are over .
also , pay attention to your  |||  subject  |||  's language .
scott peterson famously slipped and used the past tense while claiming his murdered  |||  wife  |||  was alive , launching a nationwide search for her .
deceptive individuals might also use distancing language : " i did not have sexual relations with that woman ... miss lewinsky " or repeat a  |||  hard  |||  question in its entirety .
someone might use lots of " qualifying language " when answering a  |||  hard  |||  question : " well ... to tell you the truth ... as far as i know ... to the best of my knowledge . "
this renders the  |||  answer  |||  perceptual rather than factual and is often a red flag .
there 's no magic bullet for detecting lies , but developing skills to ferret out deception is  |||  possible  |||  .
days after the obama administration threatened to delay approval of a  |||  planned  |||  oil pipeline from canada to the gulf of mexico -- angering unions while appeasing environmentalists -- the company seeking to build the pipeline says it 's willing to reroute the project to get it back on track .
the company  |||  announced  |||  the decision at a news conference at the nebraska capitol .
transcanada official alex pourbax says the company remains confident it will eventually get a pipeline  |||  approved  |||  , albeit with a different route .
that comes after the state department 's announcement last week that it would delay a decision on a federal permit for the project until it studies new potential routes that avoid the sandhills areas of nebraska and the ogallala aquifer , a  |||  vast  |||  underground water supply .
" this is a  |||  real  |||  path forward , " rep. lee terry , a republican from nebraska , told fox news .
obama , in a written statement last week , described the decision as the state department 's  |||  call  |||  , and expressed support for it .
the 1,700 - mile pipeline would extend from canada to the gulf of  |||  mexico  |||  .
to do so would  |||  require  |||  it crossing six states .
it is hated by environmentalists but loved by labor groups , who have banked on the  |||  estimated  |||  20,000 jobs tied to the pipeline .
but nebraska lawmakers opposed to the plan are weighing legislation to force a move away from the sand hills region and ogallala aquifer , a  |||  major  |||  source of drinking water and irrigation .
the state department 's current environmental impact study found the project would pose only limited adverse environmental impacts , but the energy industry source said the department 's inspector  |||  general  |||  has ordered a separate probe of the review process , centering on two questions .
one is whether a lobbyist hired by transcanada , paul elliott , who was a campaign adviser to hillary clinton in 2008 , represents a  |||  conflict  |||  of interest for the program .
the other is whether a  |||  firm  |||  that was hired to conduct the original study was an inappropriate choice because it was tied to transcanada .
patti labelle sued for allegedly  |||  causing  |||  toddler to vomit out of fear
the " lady marmalade " singer 's tirade frightened 18 - month - old genevieve monk so badly that she suffered " personality changes , sleep disorder " and "  |||  increased  |||  fear of strangers , " her family says in the manhattan supreme court suit .
it was nov. 10 of  |||  last year  |||  when stagehand kevin monk , his kindergarten - teacher wife , roseanna , and genevieve were getting ready to go on a family trip .
while kevin monk got the car , roseanna monk came  |||  down  |||  to the lobby of their riverside boulevard building with their luggage , carrying genevieve .
roseanna monk said she stopped near the door and put her daughter down for a  |||  moment  |||  .
" she said in an aggressive tone , " you should n't have left your  |||  daughter  |||  by the door , " " roseanna monk said .
" i  |||  told  |||  her , " i have no interest in what you say or think . ' "
she became enraged and  |||  started  |||  using profanities -- the c - word and the f - word in a loud voice ...
she had a bottle of water and  |||  started  |||  flicking water from the bottle on me .
" i said to this woman , "  |||  look  |||  what you 've done to my daughter , " " the child 's mother said .
the suit seeks unspecified damages , but the family 's lawyer , sam davis , said he took the case for  |||  free  |||  and that the family plans to donate any money it gets to a children 's cancer charity .
" that kind of behavior is completely unacceptable ,  |||  especially  |||  when aimed at a kindergarten teacher carrying an 18 - month - old child . "
the climatic adversity slowed down the  |||  economy  |||
during the first year of mario lopez valdez management , in sinaloa  |||  increased  |||  the unemployment and the informality , foreign investment declined and the economy was reduced .
according to the report regarding the areas affected by the frost , issued by the mexican council for sustainable rural development there were damaged 835.582 hectares , out of which 78.03 percent suffered  |||  total  |||  damage and the remaining of 21.07 percent had partial damage . the main damaged crops were the vegetables , corn and chickpea .
the  |||  fall  |||  in the economic activity has generated , until november , a constant increase of the unemployment in the state , according to the national institute of statistics and geography , the unemployment state rate during the first three quarters of the year registered an accelerated growth , from january to march 55.053 sinaloa habitants were unemployed , with a rate of 4.53 percent of the economically active population for the second quarter , the rate became 5.28 percent , and between july and september the average continued to increase to 6.19 percent , a rate that in terms of the number of people represents more than 74.000 of unemployed sinaloa habitants , an increase compared to the first half of 18.969 individuals .
|||  lower  |||  liquidity
unemployment in sinaloa during the year is multi - factorial , for the economist gerardo lopez cervantes , director at the faculty of economics and social sciences of the uas , the growth of unemployment can be explained indirectly , depending on the  |||  actions  |||  that the public policy has been taken .
" what we 're seeing now is an increase of the unemployment that has to do with several factors , including the loss of liquidity in the market for the purpose of a resource constraint imposed by the legislation that  |||  passed  |||  in the congress in order to combat money laundering since for the people who illegally possess dollars is not easy work with , invest and use them in something " he said .
|||  stopped  |||  immigration
lopez cervantes said that in the increase of unemployment there is also a  |||  demographic  |||  factor .
" the number of people who leaves the state in search of a job abroad , in the united states has been restricted , first of all due to the difficulties to enter , and second of all because once they enter they already have too many difficulties in finding a job , that group of people is staying and demanding jobs here , in the state , causing the rate of unemployment to  |||  rise  |||  , " he said .
the labor market analysis of sinaloa gets worse when considering the high level of informality that prevails among the  |||  working  |||  conditions , according to inegi , 60.38 percent of the active population in the state works without being quoted as workers to any social security institution .
in addition to the unemployment and informality ,  |||  another  |||  state labor reminder is represented by low wages ; the entity has the lowest wages in the country , according to the records of the mexican social security institute and the ministry of labor and social welfare .
the monthly average income of sinaloa workers was , until september , 5.352 pesos , well below the  |||  national  |||  average , that is of 7.375 pesos .
in addition to the  |||  fall  |||  in economic activity and high unemployment rate , in 2011 there was recorded the largest decline in foreign direct investment over the past 10 years , according to the ministry of finance from january to june the state fdi totaled 630.697 dollars , which represents a fall of 87.74 percent compared to the 5.143.312 dollars during the same period of last year .
for its part , the ministry of  |||  economic  |||  development of the state government accounted a total investment of 17.280.000 pesos during the year , which occurred mainly in tertiary sector companies .
|||  debt  |||
|||  reactions  |||
miguel loredo lopez , president of the national chamber of transformation industry , said that during 2011 there was a lack of harmonization of the wills of various sectors , including the state government  |||  itself  |||  .
" the performance of the economy in sinaloa this year has been really poor , one has to work hard in order to regain the ground  |||  lost  |||  this year , in 2012 we must redouble our efforts , we failed to align the efforts of all and above all the good and synchronized motion of the new government team , we hope that next year will be much better " he said .
|||  economic  |||  slowness
lopez loredo said that the events such as  |||  early  |||  frost this year stopped the state economy and its performance and growth were restricted .
teodoro salazar uriarte , president of the employers " confederation of the mexican republic in sinaloa , said that the state is  |||  required  |||  to prosecute the most dynamic productive activities .
" overall , we found that there has been working on , we  |||  believe  |||  it is necessary to develop a long term program that redefines the vocation and the economic course of the state , it is important to detonate all the material and human potential resource that sinaloa has , " he said .
coparmex president stressed the importance of  |||  establishing  |||  a future vision to guide better the efforts of the government .
" overall i would say that the government has been striving to be successful in various fields , in terms of  |||  economic  |||  development there is some progress but it is important to develop a long - term program , " he said .
he noted that the current  |||  administration  |||  has shown progress in its own manner of leading the public policy .
" there are elements that allow us saying that the government is becoming more inclusive , and what i can say is that there is work done and i think the government is  |||  aware  |||  that there is work to do , " he said .
five years in prison and a  |||  fine  |||  of 100 days was the sentence given to a navolato citizen for the possession of eight kilos of marijuana .
the  |||  general  |||  attorney office reported that the sentenced drug dealer is omar alexis valenzuela sandoval , for the crime against health , in its variant of possession of marijuana for purposes of trade .
the drug dealer was driving a white pickup truck , where he was carrying a  |||  black  |||  bag in the box of the vehicle and on the passenger 's seat a small backpack , where the soldiers found eight kilograms and 23 grams of marijuana .
for these reasons , the insured was put at the disposal of the second district court and the sentenced person continues to be a prisoner at the center for supporting the legal consequences of the  |||  crime  |||  .
the social works referred to in the programs such as habitat , rescue of public spaces and 3x1 for migrants risk not to be completed or to have  |||  serious  |||  delays due to the lack of funds , said miguel angel lopez miranda .
the director of municipal social development indicated that although so far the work programs have advanced they are at  |||  risk  |||  because the state government failed to make the contributions that correspond , which represent a resource superior to 11 million pesos in all three programs .
" they have to contribute with almost 12 million and even though the year is ending they have not given us a dime , since starting with july they had to give us a part , " he said , " in order not to delay we have  |||  started  |||  the works and they are very advanced , but we need the money . "
" it happened to us in the previous administration because the state did not have the financial capacity to participate and the programs continued advancing , and this year in  |||  order  |||  to access these programs we had to get the resources to cover what the state left pending , " he explained .
although there is a commitment of the state authorities to comply with the delivery of these resources , he said that the request was made ​​to the secretary of  |||  administration  |||  and finance , armando villarreal , to speed up the efforts so that the percentages that correspond to them to come as quickly as possible .
" they have to contribute with almost 12 million and even though the  |||  year  |||  is ending they have not given us a dime . "
the  |||  court  |||  validates " digital television transition " in mexico in 2015
the replacement of analog with digital is one of the most important changes that has hit the world in  |||  recent  |||  years
with this result , the constitutional controversy promoted by the senate , was  |||  rejected  |||  for not meeting the qualified majority of eight votes for the court to pronounce on the constitutionality or unconstitutionality of the decree , and this remains in force .
the sentence project prepared by the minister olga sánchez cordero ,  |||  proposed  |||  to declare unconstitutional the decree , because the regulation of radio and television materials is a power reserved by law to the federal telecommunications commission ( cofetel ) , in violation of the principles of hierarchical subordination and law reserve .
only zaldivar , jorge mario pardo , margarita luna and sánchez cordero  |||  voted  |||  for the project .
at the ministers "  |||  meeting  |||  there was also decided to reject the claim filed by the chamber of deputies , without entering into the discussion of the project , also in charge of the minister sánchez cordero .
in his speech , the minister said he did not agree with the arguments of the project in the sense that the federal executive cannot structure through  |||  general  |||  rules the measures for the public administration to get prepared .
delaying the change , he said , would mean delaying the benefits of digitization , which involves a public interest decision , which has not only a technical dimension , " as it covers economic , social , political and national security  |||  issues  |||  . "
these issues , he said , " require the operation of the entire system  |||  established  |||  under the principle of the state economic stewardship , comprises a group of powers which the constitution leads to the state executive power . "
there cannot be concluded that the government , by issuing the contested decree , that invades in any way the competence of the congress , is providing in the administrative area the  |||  observation  |||  of the laws issued by the legislature , he said .
they analyze the  |||  possibility  |||  of a " vote by vote " count in michoacán
according to the data transmitted by the perp the difference between the first and  |||  second  |||  place in the gubernatorial election is of only 27 percent , even without counting the votes corresponding to 879 of the total of 6.074 minutes .
the possibility of counting " vote by vote " is a reality as regards the electoral process of this year in michoacán , where according to the data obtained from the preliminary electoral results program ( perp ) the difference between the first and the  |||  second  |||  place of the governor 's election is of only 27 percent , even without counting the votes that correspond to 879 of the total 6.074 minutes .
in this regard , the president of the  |||  general  |||  council of michoacán electoral institute ( mei ) , maria de los angeles llanderal zaragoza , recalled that a few days ago , the last november 9th , the electoral body approved a set of guidelines in order to harmonize the local regulations with the electoral federal reform .
as it will be recalled , michoacán did not authorize the constitution or the electoral code of the state or the electoral justice act , since the congress of the state  |||  approved  |||  the reforms shortly before the legal deadline for them to come into force in this electoral process and the governor leonel godoy rangel omitted its publication within the periods specified in the law in the state official gazette , arguing that he had some objections .
interviewed about the possibility of the " vote by vote , " maria de los angeles llanderal stated that with the adoption of the appropriate guidelines by the  |||  general  |||  council of the mei it will be possible to perform partial and total counts of the vote by the local electoral body .
thus , the partial recount of one or more electoral boxes may occur in the assumptions that : the results of the records do not match ; there is no  |||  record  |||  of the count on the record of the box or they are not included in the power of the president ; or when there are obvious errors or alterations of the minutes .
in addition , the total count of the vote received in all boxes of the election may take place when there is an indication that the difference between the alleged candidate winner of the election in question and the one who has obtained the second place in the voting , is equal to or less than one percentage  |||  point  |||  , as long as at the beginning of the session there is a request of the representative of the party and / or coalition that nominated the second of the mentioned candidates .
there should be  |||  noted  |||  that in this situation is the election of morelia , where according to perp the difference between the first and the second place is of just 0.16 percent , even without counting the votes of 129 of the 923 total minutes .

wednesday there will be formed the new  |||  italian  |||  government
the appointed prime minister , mario monti , will meet tomorrow with the president of italy in order to  |||  present  |||  the new government that will face the crisis that has put the country on the edge of an economic disaster
the designated italian prime minister , mario monti , will meet wednesday with the president of italy in order to  |||  present  |||  the new government that will face the crisis that has put italy on the edge of an economic disaster and has endangered the entire euro zone .
a statement from the presidential palace  |||  announced  |||  that monti , named on sunday , will meet on wednesday with the president , giorgio napolitano , to confirm that he can form a government .
he is expected to  |||  present  |||  a cabinet composed largely of technocrats , although it is unclear when the new executive will undertake the position .
monti said the he will  |||  present  |||  to the president the results of his talks with the political parties in his attempt to form a government .
" i want to confirm my complete confidence in the ability of our country of getting out of this  |||  difficult  |||  phase , " said the former european commissioner to the reporters .
the "  |||  framework  |||  is now well delineated , " he said .
monti has completed the process of forming a government in less than three days , much less than the  |||  normal  |||  , while italy fought a political and financial crisis that has driven the cost of its debt to unsustainable levels .
the new administration led by the former european commissioner monti must approve a tough austerity package demanded by the european leaders in  |||  order  |||  to regain the confidence in italy .
underlying the pressure on monti to hurry , the instable markets put the yield of the  |||  italian  |||  btp bonds to 10 - year above 7 percent , the level at which greece and ireland were forced to be rescued .
emma marcegaglia , leader of the italian employers ' federation told the reporters after  |||  meeting  |||  with monti : " we said we would support very much this government . "
we believe that this  |||  government  |||  is the last chance for italy to get out of this emergency situation .
monti 's chances of success were considerably boosted by the  |||  support  |||  of the ldp party of silvio berlusconi , who was forced to resign on saturday due to the crisis .
" we believe that the efforts of professor monti are destined to have a good outcome , " said to the reporters angelino alfano ,  |||  secretary  |||  of the center - right party .
the support of the ldp , the largest party in italy , is  |||  significant  |||  because until now many of its members had opposed the government majority made of technocrats that monti is forming .
parliamentary  |||  support  |||
monti 's new government must have a strong parliamentary support for applying the reforms that are likely to be unpopular  |||  austerity  |||  reforms .
any blockage or  |||  delay  |||  in their efforts could lead to a new and devastating attack on the financial markets .
the italian association of foreign banks added to the pressure by warning that a  |||  failure  |||  of monti would be a disaster .
monti began on monday his consultations with the political parties , unions and  |||  business  |||  groups , as well as with youth and women organizations .
he will end his meeting on tuesday  |||  night  |||  .
monti was appointed on sunday by napolitano , who has enabled an extremely  |||  rapid  |||  transition in response to the crisis .
after a brief rest at the end of last week , when it became clear that berlusconi would resign , the italian debt costs have now reached  |||  critical  |||  levels between uncertainties about whether the new prime minister will succeed .
rescuing italy with a public debt of 1.8 billion euros would be too much for the  |||  current  |||  financial defenses of the euro zone .
monti said he would like to include politicians in his cabinet , but the  |||  major  |||  parties insist that it must be made only of technicians , an indication of his objections to a process forced by the financial pressure .
political sources said that the mutual mistrust and disagreement between the parties are complicating the attempt to include political  |||  figures  |||  .
the familiarity of the  |||  spanish  |||  is higher than that of the ticos
on the side of costa rica only one of 22 called players  |||  reached  |||  50 games .
a minor contrast to costa rica , comparing the 22 players called by both countries for the  |||  friendly  |||  game today , at 3:05 pm at the national stadium in san jose .
while the world and europe champions ,  |||  number  |||  one in the monthly top of fifa , have a long record of class a inter selection , the tricolor has only the defender michael umana as the only one who has 50 international games .
that number was  |||  reached  |||  friday before the game against panama ( 0-2 ) , in rommel fernandez .
spanish football players playing in the all - star league and in  |||  powerful  |||  clubs of the premier league of england are during the year very active in league and local cup competitions and there are high - level shocks in the european cups and champions league .
to this is added the spanish fury experience in  |||  complicated  |||  qualifications for euro and world cup .
the ticos players , however , have a limited international experience in an area such as concacaf , which is  |||  considered  |||  the lowest level within fifa
casillas will play today against the tricolor and will impose a new  |||  record  |||  of 127 international matches for spain .
casillas and xavi were recognized  |||  last  |||  week by uefa together with the other player of the iberian team , zubizarreta with 126 matches and schalke striker raul gonzalez with 102 .
on costa rican side , and  |||  close  |||  to michael umana , are the left - lateral junior diaz , with 48 matches and the striker bryan ruiz , with 45 .
on the  |||  national  |||  side , with less than 30 presences , there are roy miller with 26 , winston parks with 26 , gabriel badilla with 25 and roy myrie with 23 .
while nacho moreal has only  |||  four  |||  games and jordi alba two , in costa rica victor bolivar has only one olman vargas and nelson edder did not debut yet .
the leading scorer of spain is david villa is , with 50 goals ,  |||  followed  |||  by fernando torres with 27 .
in an exclusive interview with viva , the bassist jeff ament , of pearl jam , said the band is ready to  |||  offer  |||  one of its best concerts next sunday at the national stadium .
this was stated by the bassist and founding member , jeff ament , who spoke exclusively with viva , from brazil ,  |||  last  |||  week .
the group is on the south american zone within the tour celebrating two decades of work and sunday 20th will make its only  |||  stop  |||  in central america .
that day they will be present at the  |||  national  |||  stadium , starting at 7:30 pm , together with the band of los angeles the x and the band of the nationals las robertas .
this is an excerpt of the conversation , whose  |||  full  |||  transcript is online in the nation .
this is only our second time in south and central  |||  america  |||  and so far has been great .
it took us almost 21 years to get to costa rica , thanks for waiting so  |||  long  |||  and we regret that it took us so long to get here .
some people as regards your concert refer to it as the biggest  |||  show  |||  of the year .
we love this country , we love to surf and the jungle , for both things , costa rica is one of the  |||  best  |||  countries in the world .
how did you discover costa rica and its  |||  waves  |||  for surfing ?
we have many friends who are surfers and i have a great friend who  |||  lives  |||  in tamarindo and the waves here are incredible .
my friends are always going to surf in costa rica and nicaragua , along with mexico , these are great places to surf , and that 's how we learned about , through people who  |||  love  |||  surfing .
what have you  |||  planned  |||  for the presentation in costa rica ?
we will try to make the best  |||  show  |||  possible with a good variety of songs ; we will try to play a couple of songs of each album and give our fans a good and diverse repertoire .
i think it 's partly because we have nine discs and we can play more than 120 songs and everyone likes different songs , so it 's difficult to  |||  choose  |||  which songs to play every night .
that makes the  |||  show  |||  more interesting for us and therefore i think it also makes it more interesting for the people .
looking back , is it hard to  |||  believe  |||  all you have made ?
we count our blessings and we are very excited that we can  |||  continue  |||  making music together .
we all  |||  love  |||  each other and love making music .
what does it mean for you having been a fundamental  |||  part  |||  of the rise of grunge ?
it has always been an honor to be a  |||  part  |||  of that group of great bands .
we are good  |||  friends  |||  of the people of soundgarden , mudhoney and alice in chains .
from time to time , arises a band of a  |||  city  |||  , but it is much more strange when five or ten bands come out at the same time from the same city .
we are proud and honored to be  |||  part  |||  of the seattle group .
i still  |||  play  |||  with some of them from time to time .
|||  last  |||  year , we were at a festival with alice in chains and we were in canada with mudhoney , we saw soundgarden in its tour , so we are fortunate to be friends with all of them and we are honored to be part of the seattle sound that aroused .
it is also very strange that a band like yours remains united with the same  |||  members  |||  for so long .
yes , four of us were  |||  together  |||  for 21 years and matt ( cameron ) joined us 13 years ago , which , by itself , is much longer than many bands lasted .
we are all very close friends and , thanks to this , there have also been  |||  opened  |||  musical avenues that give each the freedom to experiment .
we trust  |||  each  |||  other with the music of each and this could not be better .
as we have grown , it has been easier to find a  |||  balance  |||  .
we take care of not being too much on tour because it is easy to  |||  fall  |||  into this game of big crowds and people who love your music .
while one remembers that people are there for the music , that reminds you that you must respect the music and what brought it , without setting your mind on being  |||  famous  |||  and being a rock star , something that none of us really cares about .
how do you remember your other project manother  |||  love  |||  bone ?
there were many frustrations because lasted so  |||  long  |||  and the most important thing is that we are still close friends of bruce ( fair - weather ) and greg ( gilmore ) , who started in the band with us and when i hear a song or see a picture i think of the incredible person that andy was and how he made ​​me laugh , it was always a pleasure to go to work , laugh , talk about music and football and much more .
is it  |||  true  |||  that you know its work , especially eddie vedder , and that 's why you chose it for the opening ?
yes , the production  |||  sent  |||  us several videos proposals and that was the band that we liked most , so we 're anxious to see what las robertas can offer live and should be very entertaining .
why do you always change the lyrics of  |||  yellow  |||  ledbetter live ?
that is a  |||  question  |||  for ed ( eddie vedder ) , so i do not know .
as a bassist , what are your  |||  influences  |||  ?
how did pearl jam succeeded to  |||  maintain  |||  grunge relevant despite of not being any longer a fad ?
i think all of us  |||  feel  |||  a bit disconnected from the word grunge .
when i think of it , it reminds me of the bands i  |||  mentioned  |||  before , like mudhoney , soundgarden , nirvana and all that came at the same time , and if it is important now , i think it 's wonderful because it is music worth listening to and bands as mudhoney are making now music better than ever .
at first , your  |||  music  |||  had a darker content , and now has become more positive .
how do you explain this  |||  change  |||  ?
also , i think you can be a happy  |||  person  |||  and still be able to make music that is dark .

mujica travels to mexico to strengthen  |||  political  |||  ties
an official delegation headed by the uruguayan president josé mujica , and composed of several ministers and businessmen , will  |||  begin  |||  this tuesday a visit to mexico in order to expand trade between the two countries and to approach political issues in the region .
mujica will meet next wednesday his mexican equal , felipe calderon , the highest point of an extensive agenda of meetings with political , commercial authorities and a meeting with the community of uruguayans  |||  living  |||  in mexico , according to the schedule released by the uruguayan presidency .
the meeting between both presidents , in the city of guadalajara , will be " favorable for the exchange of information as regards the political issues between the two nations , " as  |||  published  |||  the presidency of the south american country on its website .
in his speech , sarkozy threatened to exclude from the international community those countries that remain tax havens , a statement that  |||  caused  |||  the refusal of uruguay and the call to consultation of its ambassador in the european country .
mexico presides since november , the g 20 , a group composed of the world 's most powerful developed and emerging countries , and has in effect with the south american country since january this year , an agreement to exchange tax information in order to avoid  |||  double  |||  taxation .
the uruguayan government has attempted in recent years to speed up the conclusion of tax exchanging arrangements in  |||  order  |||  to leave the " gray list " of the organization for economic cooperation and development ( oecd ) , composed of countries that did not implement all international standards of tax cooperation .
on the trade plan , mexico and uruguay have in force since 2004 a free trade agreement ( fta ) that has  |||  increased  |||  the exchange of goods between both countries .
the mustachioed plumber comes to be three - dimensional with " super mario 3d  |||  land  |||  "
super mario has fought tirelessly for over 25 years to  |||  save  |||  princess peach from the evil clutches of bowser , but never before he had done this in three dimensions : in " super mario 3d land " he will fight for the love of the girl in stereoscopic technology .

" mario is the character who has to say how it should work the stereoscopy without glasses , " said the press head of nintendo in spain , omar alvarez , during the  |||  presentation  |||  of the game in madrid .
alvarez said that " super mario 3d  |||  land  |||  " is " the first video game of nintendo originally designed for this support , " because until now successes like " star fox 64 3d " or " zelda : ocarina of time 3d " were adaptations of existing titles .
nintendo spokesman has claimed that , despite being in 3d , " super mario 3d  |||  land  |||  " is an " accessible " video game which allows enjoying a quick and fluid game .
alvarez said that " super mario 3d land " contains two games in one : the first part is "  |||  simple  |||  " to engage less skilled users .
once pasted , most experts will give a " second round " to the levels of the play , which this time , are more  |||  difficult  |||  .
in addition , the users can choose in real - time between " d aggressive " or one that only affects the depth of the  |||  action  |||  , but will need to be played in three dimensions in order to overcome the various challenges and " not to succumb optical illusions . "
this incursion of super mario in three dimensions represents also the  |||  return  |||  of the character to a portable console , fact that has not occurred since 2005 .
|||  although  |||  the player will find new movements , the surroundings , costumes and enemies and also a " playable " luigi .

when the operation was finished the lock on the door was changed in order to  |||  prevent  |||  a repeat of the situation .
" from now on there will be an  |||  access  |||  control , " said the manager .
next to the building there is a nightclub , balmes 51 , which has also been  |||  damaged  |||  .
the owner of the club says that the invaders of the farm made ​​her an unfair competition , since they were selling drinks for three euros , while in the club  |||  worth  |||  10 .
in addition , the owner of the disco had to respond to neighborhood complaints of noise , while , as she noted , the noise was not caused by customers of the club , but by the inhabitants of the squat and , above all , those attending the parties that were organized there , which had  |||  increased  |||  in frequency and intensity in recent weeks , as the angry neighbors said .
the head of the club said that the discomfort was so great that even reached an agreement with the  |||  owner  |||  of the property and there are now nine months since she " forgives " him for paying the rent .
the city police also confirmed that in recent weeks has  |||  received  |||  more complaints from neighbors about the situation .
the chairman of the pp municipal group , of the council alberto fernández díaz , had claimed last week " to immediately evacuate the  |||  building  |||  in order to solve the problems of coexistence and community spirit caused to neighbors , and the degradation of the area . "
in this sense , he added that " it is necessary to put an end to  |||  impunity  |||  and to be strongly against the incivility that has been generated on the farm . "
also yesterday , the members of the police evacuated a  |||  building  |||  in nou barris .
the four were  |||  arrested  |||  at the time .
park or  |||  mountain  |||  ?
the municipal contest on the 16 doors reopened the  |||  debate  |||  on the role of collserola in barcelona
the booklet  |||  defined  |||  the mountain as the great park of the metropolitan barcelona .
on the death of the mcb , in 1987 , the park was placed again in the minds of many , as the upper limit of barcelona , ​​being the catalan capital one of the few that is not oriented towards the north - south but up ( mountain ) -  |||  down  |||  ( sea ) .
the classification of collserola as a  |||  natural  |||  park redounds in this idea .
the reference was not  |||  central  |||  park , but yellowstone , with the wild boar on the role of yogi bear .
|||  either  |||  that or someone wants to put gates to the field .
the question comes  |||  alone  |||  : collserola ? park or mountain ?
the competition , both as for its merely organizational side as for its  |||  reflection  |||  on the city is a topic of conversation among all architects of barcelona .
miguel roldan ,  |||  daniel  |||  modolo and mara bayona : the competition is appropriate
for roland , after approaching the coastline becomes "  |||  necessary  |||  " to discuss about " the mountain front , " whenever ildefons cerda 's speech , that of green apples has not been carried out .
among other things , for its great  |||  accessibility  |||  .
collserola is more complex , " says the architect to  |||  whom  |||  the title of " gates of collserola " contains a " lexical trap " : we should not think about them " as access to a park , but as the delimitation of some areas where we must act . "
hazards arising from the " uncertainty of projecting the public  |||  space  |||  " after the experience of the 80 " s which had in the forum area " his swan song . "
the first fear is the own delimitation of the borders where to  |||  build  |||  .
" limiting something is setting up the  |||  next  |||  step , " meaning , overcoming .
" we must think of new urban planning tools , because the current [ in reference to the  |||  general  |||  metropolitan plan ( gmp ) ] can lead to a real disaster . "
and further , understands that the proximity of the mountain with the city is the pass that allows architects to enter the debate , but " he doubts " about whether this technical profile is the one that should  |||  lead  |||  multidisciplinary teams ( " a success , " he points ) that have had to create : " the architects should be only a tool . "
otherwise , a project for one of the gates can crash into the program and  |||  definition  |||  with the project of the architect of the next gate .
in your opinion , the council should ensure that the band immediately above the ronda de dalt should  |||  provide  |||  in its entirety , an area of equipment to conduct a smooth transition between the city and the green .
after spending 72 days in jail , manuel jonas larrazabal will be free after the legal representative of the red casino  |||  granted  |||  him forgiveness before the second criminal court district , which follows a process of blackmail against the brother of the mayor of monterrey .
after the public condemnation , the state general attorney  |||  opened  |||  a criminal case against the mayor 's brother and on september 2nd , he was arrested and imprisoned for 30 days .
after four hours before the agent of the public ministry for heritage crimes , he was transferred to the temporary jail ,  |||  located  |||  in the old neighborhood of the state capital .
in this place he remained for 49 days following the pronunciation of a second restriction  |||  order  |||  after the prosecutor dismissed the crimes of bribery and organized crime .
after the hearing of the legal representative of the bookmarkers , at almost 15:50 it was ordered the  |||  immediate  |||  release of larrazabal breton .
also he will notify him about the immediate release  |||  order  |||  issued by the judge .
the secretary dionisio perez jacome gives details of the crash where the interior minister , francisco blake , and seven  |||  others  |||  died .
the ministry of communications and transportation ( mct ) reported that the results obtained on the accident in which the interior secretary francisco blake mora , and seven others died , indicate that the helicopter hit directly the ground in complete structural integrity , without the pilot attempting a  |||  forced  |||  landing .
" the elements that seem to indicate that the unit had several contacts with the ground , the blades came into contact with trees at 25 meters where the unit  |||  lost  |||  the fuselage . "
he also reported that the unit was  |||  designed  |||  for 19 people , so it fulfilled the necessary requirements to transport people .
he also said that the investigations made ​​in the area of impact do not report the appearance of pieces on the  |||  ground  |||  .
" in a research it is reported that there are no parts or components of the ship in  |||  another  |||  place , the impact is presented in a structural way .
the land has a slope of seven degrees to 30  |||  degrees  |||  .
for now , the  |||  secretary  |||  said it is a priority to have the results as soon as possible ; however , the investigation may take several months or even one year .
meanwhile , gilberto lopez meyer ,  |||  general  |||  director of airports and auxiliary services , said that at the time of the impact , the presidential helicopter was operating in cruising speed and that this happened in a soft ascending land .
" this information reinforces the hypothesis of a  |||  normal  |||  cruise operation at the time of the impact , " he said .
at the press conference , the owner of the sct , perez jacome ,  |||  listed  |||  six important elements in the investigation :
visual  |||  flight  |||  :
weather  |||  conditions  |||  :
|||  selected  |||  routes :
it is likely that due to cloud conditions the crew has searched an area of  |||  lower  |||  elevation and greater visibility into the valley of cuernavaca .
the coordinates of the impact and the last  |||  record  |||  of the aircraft radar match , probably before the impact there was no loss of control or change in the flight direction .
the information  |||  available  |||  so far suggests that the impact occurred in a straight and lateral line .
there was not detected evidence of  |||  fire  |||  or explosion :
on the area of the accident there remains undisclosed evidence in the wreckage of the craft , some kind of explosion or  |||  fire  |||  .
the pictures  |||  show  |||  the sequence in which it dismantled along that journey .
after a thorough research in a wider area than the surrendered off area , near the place the  |||  accident  |||  took place , there have not been found scattered pieces of the aircraft , which strengthens the assumption that the impact is presented in terms of structural integrity .
social security directs a research to find the gene for obesity in children and young people ; it is supported by  |||  specialists  |||  from the ipn
the mexican social security institute ( mssi ) has announced that conducts a research to  |||  discover  |||  the gene for obesity in children and young people , called the protocol of ' genetics of obesity in childhood and adolescence ' , which will provide counting on markers associated with overweight .
in a statement , the head of the  |||  medical  |||  research unit in biochemistry of specialties hospital , xxi century national medical center , miguel cruz lopez , explained that it was integrated a multidisciplinary team of physicians , nurses , nutritionists and social workers .
the team is supported by specialists and graduate students from the  |||  national  |||  institute of public health ( niph ) and the centre for research and advanced studies ( cinvestav ) national polytechnic institute ( npi ) .
the research invites the population entitled or not , to participate by going to the participant sport units of the mssi in the valley of mexico , where there will be carried out the tests to children ,  |||  every  |||  saturday from 8:00 o'clock .
he stressed that the protocol  |||  started  |||  in the cuauhtémoc sports unit ( west mexico state ) and since october 8th , the activity takes place in the netzahualcoyotl sport unit ( east state of mexico ) .
|||  once  |||  reached the goal of bringing 500 to 600 children , the study will continue in the independence sport unit ( south the mexico city ) and finally in the morelos sports unit ( north the mexico city ) .
he explained that the purpose of this research is to understand the components and the importance of genetics in relation to the development of obesity and  |||  identify  |||  in children and young mexicans the risk factors for preventing the appearance of chronic degenerative diseases .
on november 14th , there will be celebrated the world diabetes day , and the goal is to collect three thousand children and young people between 6 and 14 years , with the consent and parental supervision for the implementation of  |||  specific  |||  questionnaires on food .
they will also be asked about physical activity and family hereditary history of disease , in  |||  order  |||  to avoid risk factors that give rise to diseases such as diabetes or kidney failure .
cruz lopez said that this  |||  research  |||  reflects the concern of health professionals for the alarming weight gain in children .
health surveys made between 1999 and 2006 reported that in only six years there was an increase in the case of the boys , 77 percent were obese , and 47 percent in the case of the girls ; in terms of overweight there was also observed a dramatic  |||  rise  |||  , " said the specialist of the mssi .
he said the justification for searching the markers is based on that the population of the country differs from other in its genetic  |||  history  |||  .
he  |||  reported  |||  that on average , the mexican has a 65 percent of american indian heritage , 30 percent european and five percent african and this condition is reflected in the genes that are associated with diabetes and overweight .
he explained that generally , the genetics of obesity result in the inability to burn off the excess  |||  energy  |||  that we consume ( calories ) and which is stored as fat .
the researcher explained that the direct  |||  benefit  |||  for the participants is a comprehensive assessment of the children , which can detect if they have any degree of overweight or obesity .
even , he said , the presence of dark - colored folds ( acanthuses ) on the neck and forearm indicates the likelihood of  |||  suffering  |||  of metabolic disorders and even prediabetes .
cruz lopez explained that there are three  |||  major  |||  components that cause overweight , obesity and other chronic diseases : sedentary lifestyle , which is the lack of daily physical activity , staying most of the day and watching tv and using means of transport instead of walking short distances .
also it is due to the high caloric intake , meaning , and the  |||  increased  |||  consumption of sugary drinks , carbohydrate ( tamales , bread , pizza , hamburger , etc. ) with high fat and protein and genetics analyzed in this protocol .
if the signals sent by the road surface were attended , it would be necessary to repair about 200 thousand potholes every rainy season in the metropolitan area of valley of mexico , said rafael herrera najera , a researcher at the chemistry faculty ( cf ) of the unam , who said that if the process of construction and maintenance of an asphalt pavement is adequate , the potholes could be  |||  reduced  |||  or even completely eliminated .
he explained that the asphalt , the heavier oil  |||  part  |||  is a set of hydrocarbon molecules , some of high molecular weight , called asphaltenes , and other of low molecular weight , called maltenes , which together give the road surface its viscoelastic characteristic behavior .
the viscoelastic behavior of the asphalt consists in the fact that at  |||  high  |||  temperatures near 180 degrees , it behaves like a liquid at 120° c , its viscosity is very high and at 50 degrees celsius has a nearly solid state , whereas at very low temperatures the asphalt becomes fragile , he said .
cf researcher observed that the streets of mexico city are mostly  |||  covered  |||  by flexible pavement , which is composed of six layers of material , out of which the last three involve the asphalt .
among the most superficial layers is the asphalt , composed of  |||  small  |||  stones dipped into the asphalt and then compacted .
|||  each  |||  of the stones which compose this covering , he said , is dipped with asphalt .
on the asphalt covering , he added , is placed a  |||  final  |||  layer called rolling covering , which is made ​​of a fine stone material , meaning sand also dipped into the asphalt .
since this is the layer that will be in contact with the wheels of the vehicle , it must have a better mechanical strength than the asphalt covering and  |||  provide  |||  road friction .
the weather , especially humidity and temperature variations are also a very important factor to consider , especially water , he said , because it  |||  greatly  |||  affects the performance of the asphalt .
when the ground is wet , water diffuses inside the covering and it 's  |||  hard  |||  to get out , this causing a softening of all layers of the pavement and , therefore , the formation of potholes .
in the formation of a pothole , he said , the first to wear is the rolling covering and only after that is affected the asphalt , but the damage does not happen instantly , it is a process that should be attended at the first signs with  |||  appropriate  |||  maintenance programs .
also a member of the national system of researchers explained that the vehicle load is another important factor in the formation of potholes and , therefore , the thickness of  |||  each  |||  layer of the pavement should be always made in relation to the vehicle load and ensure this fulfillment , in order to prevent the frequent formation of potholes .
rafael herrera said that there is still much to investigate and work to do on the asphalt , for example , asphalt emulsions , which in other countries are already on the market and even help repair potholes with easiness and without  |||  using  |||  high temperatures .
analysis of the factors that affected serna melina ramirez for not getting the crown of  |||  miss  |||  colombia .
the valley gets its  |||  title  |||  number 14 of princess .
once again cauca valley remains with the desire of the crown of  |||  miss  |||  colombia .
this time melina ramirez serna had to be content with being on the winning podium , wearing the  |||  silver  |||  crown and the band that accredited her as the new princess of colombia .
with the  |||  result  |||  obtained last night in cartagena , where miss atlantic won the crown and scepter , the department counts with 14 princess titles and melina joins the legion of women of valley of cauca who have been close to the crown but were proclaimed princesses , among them miriam ospina benoit ( 1947 ) , clara borrero dominguez ( 1949 ) , patricia bellini ayala ( 1979 ) , lorena álvarez ( 1981 ) , rose mary alzate ( 1983 ) , olga maria arenas ( 1987 ) , leila blanque ( 1988 ) , monica evers ( 1989 ) , maria consuela pinedo ( 1990 ) , diana isabel romero ( 1993 ) , giselle aljure garcés ( 2000 ) , catalina giraldo ( 2007 ) , stephanie garcés aljure ( 2008 ) .
now the big  |||  question  |||  many are asking is :
what was missing ? because the result is the defeat of a big favorite who in each performance showed that she had everything to be the new miss colombia , not in vain she was elected queen of the police and best jolie  |||  face  |||  of vogue , titles that were obtained by queens as taliana vargas or natalia navarro , who took the crown of miss colombia .
the first key factor in the decision of the jury to designate her as first princess is that she did not convince with her  |||  answer  |||  to the question " ' what is the book that has marked you and why ? asked ​​by martin murillo gomez from the literary cart let 's read .
" i read a lot , i believe a lot in literature , i think it is a form of culturalization , and i definitely think that the book that marked my childhood is " the  |||  little  |||  prince ' is a pretty deep book .
a response that the jury did not like due to the term " culturalization ' and second of all for not specifically explaining how  |||  each  |||  of the cited books have marked her .
but after the ceremony melina said she was calm and happy with the  |||  result  |||  " the universe is wise it happens what it has to happen . "
and for you all , please read a little bit , ' the  |||  little  |||  prince ' it is a great book "
|||  among  |||  the launched hypotheses it is said that valley got burned by favoritism .
a reporter from bogota  |||  suggested  |||  that for being the preferred , the acclaimed , and the candidate who received all preliminary awards ( oster food challenge , the public vote for the best traditional costume , and mother queen ) , " that aroused the jealousy of the other candidates , stressed the queen and therefore she did not shine on stage .
|||  although  |||  in both she looked confident , it was noted that she lacked the strength and energy that magdalena and atlántico representatives did show .
ariel osorio , a journalist of the program " like  |||  home  |||  ' , of the rcn channel said that the fact that melina was designated as princess " means that the candidate who more awards wins during the competition is not the queen . "
another hypothesis is that valley  |||  failed  |||  to convince the jury about her interest in social work , which is ultimately the essence of the national beauty contest .
this is why , two days before the election the international jury lucy doughty said they were  |||  seeking  |||  a woman committed to the social needs of her country .
" beauty is not enough for a miss colombia , we must  |||  look  |||  beyond the physical appearance and focus on social awareness , before entering the contest they must be already involved in projects , " she said .
there is also a speculation that valley sinned for her defects on the posterior and the fibrosis that could be seen on her abdomen , but it is contradictory because the jury specifically chose her as the candidate ' natural beauty ' with the healthier body , good nutrition and  |||  responsible  |||  physical work .
the coach of the queens jorge hernán orozco recognizes that melina did not have the best body , that there were better , " but the problem of fibrosis on the abdomen , which for me was not very noticeable , made her lose points the  |||  last  |||  day . "
" the surgeries are  |||  fine  |||  , but valley did not know how to do them .
reality or not , the fact is that melina today begins a year of reign , not as sovereign , but as a princess , a position that gives her the opportunity to represent colombia in one of the international competitions designated by the national competition  |||  itself  |||  .
such was the work of the person who  |||  identified  |||  the body of alfonso cano
a cali lophoscopist entered into history as the man who  |||  confirmed  |||  the death of " alfonso cano .
the work of these  |||  officials  |||  is a key work .
on november 4th the lophoscopist of cali cti passed into history as the man who  |||  confirmed  |||  the identity of the farc top leader , " alfonso cano , through the comparison of his fingerprints .
of the seven lophoscopists working in the branch of cti , this week it was the  |||  turn  |||  of " availability ' for eleazar gonzalez , a man of puerto tejada , who had spent 21 years working in the area of judicial investigation .
at the beginning of his career , gonzalez worked in municipalities of chocó , where he often had to go for more than five days in the jungle to reach the place where there were the bodies that should be  |||  identified  |||  .
the week of eliazar 's operation against alias alfonso cano he was warned to take clothes only for three  |||  days  |||  .
|||  something  |||  big was coming .
he was without beard , dressed as a farmer of the  |||  area  |||  , without glasses and much thinner .
accompanied by a galtonian magnifying glass , ink , a paddle and a flashlight , eliazar compared the fingerprints of the corpse with those of the  |||  card  |||  .
that same night , the man from puerto tejada was asked to confirm the defense  |||  minister  |||  , juan carlos pinzón , that it was the top leader of the farc .
for a fingerprint specialist from sijin of cali the recognition made ​​by the president juan manuel santos to eleazar gonzalez in the press conference for the operation against " cano ' , is very  |||  significant  |||  .
the fingerprinting science is an exact science , without  |||  error  |||  , which can be key solution in solving crimes .
when captured , many criminals have  |||  fake  |||  cards or do not have papers .
" the walls are  |||  difficult  |||  because they are not suitable surfaces to get a print , but in this case we could get the print of the whole hand and identify the offender , who had participated in several robberies " he said .
the prints can also rule out or confirm suspects in  |||  murder  |||  cases .
they have recently found a  |||  dead  |||  man , with liquor bottles around him .
a fingerprint  |||  expert  |||  of cti explained that in objects " footprints are drawn with chemical or physical reagents . "
" the  |||  problem  |||  is that there are still many undocumented colombians , " said cti expert .
just as not everything that glitters is  |||  gold  |||  , not everything you touch turns into a footprint .
however , if it can be used , the  |||  comparison  |||  is being made .
the " angry persons " challenge the authorities in new  |||  york  |||
a  |||  part  |||  of the protesters listened to the eviction order and moved to a nearby park .
the members of the movement occupy wall street challenged on tuesday the authorities of new york when trying to enter again , under the protection of a court  |||  order  |||  , in the manhattan square where they were evacuated at dawn when trying to occupy another park of the big apple .
hundreds of protesters crowded round the zuccotti square , where they wanted to get in thanks to a court  |||  order  |||  that allows " the angry persons " to camp on the site , while another part of the movement responded to the eviction by occupying a park north the city where there have been made further arrests .
" our idea is that if the court does not allow us to  |||  return  |||  to camp in the square , we will camp somewhere else and continue the legal battle to return to zuccotti , and through peaceful sit - ins and demonstrations , " said one of the spokesmen of the movement " occupy wall street , " mark bray .
bray explained that the response of the " angry persons " to the evacuation of the camp issued personally by the mayor of new york , michael bloomberg , came to court , where judge lucy billings issued an order prohibiting the  |||  forced  |||  evacuation of the place and allowing the demonstrators to remain camped .
in addition , the " angry persons " proceeded to the occupation of a new park located at the confluence of the downtown canal street and sixth avenue ,  |||  near  |||  the entrance to the holland tunnel , which connects new york and new jersey , owned by the parish of trinity church .
at least for one hour they were able to occupy the place , but then the police  |||  came  |||  and proceeded to arrest some of the protesters , although bray could not confirm the precise number , while telling efe that he saw several journalists who were also handcuffed .
the organization ensures that there are several hundred people camped at that  |||  point  |||  , where a delegation of religious leaders has already gone to show their support to the members of the movement trying to mediate with the police .
some of the protesters moved there were carrying and distributing at that time copies of that court  |||  order  |||  and even they gave these copies to officers guarding the place , which led to " some small confrontations , " said bray , who claimed that some officers beaten the demonstrators .
the court  |||  order  |||  prohibits the authorities to evacuate the members of occupy wall street and enforce " laws that were issued after the beginning of the occupation or to prohibit demonstrators regain access to the park with shops and other property used before . "
the councilman personally  |||  defended  |||  the evacuation of the zuccotti square carried out at dawn , an operation in which about 200 arrests were made and this was decided so because protesters were " violating the law . "
" the evacuation of this morning was disgusting and shows that deep inside bloomberg is more interested in preserving the financial interests of  |||  american  |||  workers , " added the spokesman of the movement , who accused the mayor of " disrespect for the freedom of expression . "
the responsible of " occupy wall street " also indicated that they intend to organize " great deeds " for thursday in collaboration with community organizations and unions , in order to commemorate the  |||  last  |||  two months of protests , which began on september 17th .

|||  japan  |||  reborn after the earthquake
gdp grows by 1.5 % due to domestic consumption and puts an end to the downward spiral that  |||  began  |||  in march
the first estimates of tokyo government regarding the material losses amounted to $ 300,000 million , a blow that , despite the difficult  |||  global  |||  context , seems to have dimmed .
after three consecutive quarters of declines , the gross domestic product data between july and september helped to  |||  turn  |||  the page , definitely : gdp increased by 1.5 % compared to the previous quarter and by 6 % in annualized rate .
the one recorded in the second quarter , for the  |||  japanese  |||  the fiscal year begins in march 2012 - represents also the fastest rhythm of growth from january to march 2010 .
the recovery can be explained in  |||  part  |||  by the recovery in the purchase of machinery to restore areas devastated by the earthquake and the following tsunami .
in fact , companies  |||  increased  |||  their investment by 1.1 % versus 0.9 % decline in capital expenditures which was observed from january to march , the first decline after six months of uninterrupted increases .
however , the true revulsion of the japanese economy is not based exclusively on the keynesian impulse that invites taking advantage on the crisis to strengthen - or rebuild - infrastructure ,  |||  using  |||  of gaps to grow from scratch .
japan has awakened , especially thanks to the evolution of the household consumption , which now represents 60 % of the  |||  japanese  |||  gdp .
this variable climbed 1 % , driven by the  |||  increase  |||  of expenditure for cars , travels and leisure activities .
tokyo has entrusted to the internal market , when the yen - the nippon currency has become one of the " refuge values " chosen by investors who wanted to get rid of the debt crisis in the euro area and the negative forecasts of the u.s. , a privilege that weighs like a stone in the accounts of  |||  export  |||  companies .
with a stronger currency , the products are more expensive abroad , a serious slap for a country whose economic line is determined by the health of  |||  large  |||  technological groups .
toyota or sony , for example , blamed the yen for their  |||  weak  |||  results between july and september .
as markets  |||  continue  |||  their siege of the peripheral countries of the eu , the government of yoshihiko noda does not lower the guard .
" we must be vigilant to the risks that  |||  remain  |||  , such as the deterioration of some foreign economies , the impact of floods in thailand and the rapid appreciation of the yen , " said yesterday the secretary of state for economic policy , motohisa furukawa .
and indeed , the perspectives are not  |||  encouraging  |||  .
the organization for cooperation and economic development ( oecd ) said that most member countries showed in september  |||  clear  |||  signs of economic slowdown .
the indicator that anticipates the turning points in the  |||  global economy  |||  showed that the major powers are slowing .
since it fell four tenths to 100.4  |||  points  |||  , compared to 100.8 in august .
the euro zone even fell below the  |||  average  |||  , which is at the level of 100 , since it rushed eight tenths up to 99.13 points .
|||  athens  |||  feeds back the doubts
with peripheral  |||  risk  |||  subsidies launched and uncertainty reinstated in the parks , greece is still entangled in the maze that leads to the exit of the great european debt crisis .
while the new prime minister , lukas papademos warned yesterday that there is no alternative to structural reforms and that the period of one hundred days agreed in his appointment may be underestimated for applying them , the leader of the conservative new democracy party , antonis samaras , ensured that he will not support new  |||  austerity  |||  measures in any case and reiterated his demand for new elections scheduled on february 19th .
a package of 24 programs to  |||  boost  |||  employment , reform of the disciplinary code of civil servants and new measures against tax evasion will be the first initiatives .
however , the message of samaras does not clear the doubts about his position : " we are  |||  committed  |||  to helping the transitional government , but we are not committed to anything . "
the conservative leader was one step further in his pulse to the eu and the imf , the entities that must unfreeze the 8,000 million that athens urgently  |||  needed  |||  , and made ​​clear he will not give his approval to any letter of commitment to comply with the adjustments .
but the european commission , still having a nappy rash by the impact caused by the all or nothing statement of the papandreou referendum , reiterated yesterday that its demand is clear : it will not unlock the help if the new government and the leaders of hellene  |||  major  |||  parties do not sign " a written commitment without ambiguity and this as soon as possible . "
the economic affairs spokesman , amadeu altafaj , said the troika inspectors would return " very soon " to athens to  |||  discuss  |||  with the new government " what has to be done to pay the sixth tranche " of 8,000 million , although there is no definite date .
mrs. sofia : " they are instruments of progress and  |||  hope  |||  "
the queen highlights the " dominant " place in spain in relation to this type of  |||  finance  |||
queen sofia recalled yesterday that the country has become over the  |||  last  |||  two decades the second donor in relation to the instruments of cooperation ; whose " essence " she said lies in being an " instrument for social progress , justice and hope for a better future for all humanity , based on trust in human beings . "
the queen opened yesterday the fifth global microcredit summit in valladolid with the belief that " there is no doubt " that such operations are " absolutely essential " to achieve the millennium goals set by the united nations for 2015 , and , " especially having as a goal halving the volume of people  |||  living  |||  with less than a dollar per day , with this fixing the " poverty line . "
spain is " still  |||  working  |||  " to expand the network of beneficiaries all over the world , and assumes the task with " responsibility " said mrs. sofia , who hoped that the efforts and contributions originated in the summit , which will be held until thursday , will " ensure the creation of new capabilities and better opportunities for the poorest people , and especially for women , " the main beneficiaries of these loans .
there are " many achievements " and " many  |||  challenges  |||  we are facing . "
thus , his majesty explained that she hopes that at the end of 2015 , 175 million  |||  poor  |||  families will have acceded to these financial services and one hundred million of these households will get out of the poverty in which they are immersed .
the impulse for the creation of micro credits in spain and in the rest of the  |||  world  |||  " has followed the path started years ago " by muhammad yunus , highlighted mrs. sofia as an " act of justice and recognition . "
" ethical  |||  imperative  |||  "
foreign minister , trinidad jiménez , said that solidarity " is an ethical imperative " to  |||  every  |||  democratic state .
in this regard , she said that it would be a mistake to  |||  link  |||  cooperation with developing countries in times of economic boom , as it is a " continuing obligation . "
jimenez found that microcredit supposes " a serious and rigorous policy dedicated to eradicating poverty , " and now " more than ever , " the governments of  |||  developed  |||  countries must work under the criteria of solidarity and not let this fall as victim of adjustments .
for spain , microcredit is " one of the main  |||  lines  |||  of development cooperation . "
the secretary of state for international cooperation , soraya rodriguez , praised the " success " to give " trust " to people " excluded to  |||  whom  |||  all doors are closed , " and the mayor of valladolid , francisco javier leon de la riva , welcomed those present to a city that " opens its doors caught by the spirit of solidarity . "
cdu intends to elect the  |||  european  |||  president by universal suffrage
the first day of the congress of the christian  |||  democratic  |||  union ( cdu ) on monday 14 november , in leipzig took place without any real problems arising for the chancellor angela merkel , who is also president of the christian democratic party .
the future of europe was not initially planned to be on the programme , but imposed itself in the autumn , in particular to satisfy the militants who will be watching the  |||  government  |||  's policy on greece today and perhaps that on italy tomorrow ....
the motion on the preidency of the european commission , tabled by the directorate , was  |||  adopted  |||  almost unanimously .
out of 1001 delegates , only nine voted against and ten abstained from  |||  voting  |||  .
the standing ovation lasting several minutes which they , angela merkel and then a few hours later , wolfgang schäuble , the very europhile minister of finance , received at the end of their respective speeches , left no room for  |||  doubt  |||  .
the main idea of the chancellor and of the motion , is embodied in the slogan " the right  |||  response  |||  to the crisis is not less europe , but more europe . "
not only because europe means peace , but because " nine million  |||  jobs  |||  depend directly on the euro . "
for the  |||  chancellor  |||  , " the time has arrived for a breakthrough in europe . "
this could mean modifications of the treaty of lisbon , making it possible to strengthen the control by the european union of the budgetary policies of the countries of the eurozone , but this could also affect the election of the president of the european commission by universal suffrage " in  |||  order  |||  to impart a face to europe . "
this is , generally speaking , the case of one of the proposals of the motion  |||  adopted  |||  by the congress , whose inspiration clearly comes from wolfgang schäuble .
certainly , it is not probable that the twenty - seven will rapidly  |||  agree  |||  to this solution ; great britain is opposed to it and the heads of cdu think that nicolas sarkozy is also opposed to it .
similarly , the delegates rejected by an overwhelming majority the proposal to weight the vote of each country - member of the directorate of the european central bank according the size of its economy , which would clearly  |||  increase  |||  the weight of the german economy .
anxious to calm the climate in her party , the chancellor increased the number of her references to konrad adenauer and to helmut kohl , but she did not seek to influence the congress on the back of the " small " european countries , or of countries in  |||  difficulty  |||  , which are quick to criticise " arrogant " germany .
although the motion on europe devotes a paragraph to the importance of " franco -  |||  german  |||  friendship , " angela merkel did not mention france .
recalling that two centuries ago , leipzig was the scene of a bloody  |||  battle  |||  .
in  |||  fact  |||  , it was one of the most humiliating defeats of the napoleonic army .
after allowances , the ump and the  |||  government  |||  are launching an offensive against sick leave .
on 15 november , nicolas sarkozy will be in bordeaux to  |||  visit  |||  a family allowances allocation fund and to make a speech on this subject , which has been recurring since 2007 , concerning the fight against social assistance fraud .
and to help this  |||  offensive  |||  stemming from a desire to make economies in the context of constraints , but which also forms part of the presidential re - election campaign , the majority want to concentrate on sick leave .
first and foremost , with a view to budgetary economies , the government intends to impose on private employees a fourth day of unemployment before the  |||  start  |||  of unemployment benefit
clearly , without the specific consent of the employer , an employee falling sick will lose four days ' pay equal to at least 15 % of his / her monthly  |||  income  |||  .
and which would be accompanied by  |||  another  |||  measure with a more symbolic effect , namely , the imposition on public employees of one day 's wait for benefit payment in the case of sick leave ( public employees have not hitherto had to wait for the payment of benefit , as against a three days ' wait by private employees ) .
now that these questions are being  |||  discussed  |||  , the majority are also relaunching the subject of fraud , targeting abuses linked to medical certificates .
" the  |||  controls  |||  will become more rigid and in addition , if you are caught , you will have to repay any non - legitimate benefit received , " warned xavier bertrand on rtl on sunday 13 november .
as in other cases , the effects of the announcement  |||  appear  |||  a little disproportionate to the reality of medical certificate - related fraud .
this has actually been  |||  monitored  |||  constantly since 2002 via political offensives , which have usually borne fruit .
the french are no sicker than people elsewhere in  |||  europe  |||  .
let us first of all look at the national  |||  figures  |||  .
according to the caisse nationale d'assurance maladie ( cnam ) , over 237 million euros of daily compensation were  |||  paid  |||  in 2006 .
according to l'institut de recherche et de documentation en economie de la santé , the daily  |||  compensation  |||  expenditure in 2008 at 11,3 thousand million euros , was 5 % of total health expenditure .
of this sum , 46 %  |||  concerned  |||  maternity leave and accidents at work and 54 % sick leave benefit at 6,2 thousand million euros .
and therefore represented 2,5 % of health - related  |||  expenditure  |||  .
|||  another  |||  study , this time concerning sickness insurances , states that in 2010 , 37 % of sick leave lasted less than 8 days , 15 % 15 days to one month , 15 % from one to three months and 11 % lasted longer .
comparing these figures with those of their european neighbours ,  |||  french  |||  employees are no more inclined to take sick leave than those in any other country .
a  |||  long  |||  study carried out in 2010 by two cnrs researchers showed that between 1994 and 2001 , the global rate of absence from work in france ( for reasons of health or not ) fluctuated between 10 % and 11 % , compared with between 20 % and 28 % in denmark , 15 % in the united kingdom , or between 16 % and 18 % in the netherlands .
as regards  |||  fraud  |||  , it is very low .
the strengthening of  |||  legislation  |||  since 2002 has led to systematic controls of certificates valid for longer than 45 days .
in 2008 , out of 1,5 million controls , the cnam found that 13 % of the 285 000 controls on short - term sickness certificates were " unjustified , " or too  |||  long  |||  , " equal to 37 050 cases .
in the case of systematically  |||  controlled  |||  certificates valid for more than 45 days , 11 % cases were found to be " inappropriate or unjustified " out of 1,2 million , equal to 132 000 .
in total therefore , 169 000 cases were " unjustified , " out of  |||  several  |||  million of employees issued with certificates .
a  |||  figure  |||  which represents very few cases , compared , for example , with the " black " labour figure .
according to the ump deputy dominique tian , author of a report on the subject in june , this would represent 9 to 15 thousand million euros annual tax shortfall , equal to more than the total cost of daily  |||  compensation  |||  and therefore infinitely higher than losses due to fraud .
greece needs a new programme of adjustment to  |||  rescue  |||  its economy .
" to pursue the efforts of rescuing the economy , we need the support of our european partners and a new programme of budgetary adjustment "  |||  declared  |||  the head of government , who made his first public speech opening the debate on the vote of confidence in parliament on wednesday .
the implementation of the decisions taken at the summit of the eurozone on 27 october shall be the " principal task " of the new  |||  government  |||  , because participation of the country in the eurozone " is at stake , " he added .
consequently , m. papademos forecast that the country 's  |||  public  |||  deficit would be reduced to " about 9 % " of the pib by the end of the year , after having been 10.6 % in 2010 and 15.7 % in 2009 .
the right rejects new  |||  austerity  |||  measures
on monday , antonis samaras , the leader of the right , gave his support to already approved measures to try and emerge from the debt crisis , but warned that his party would not support additional  |||  austerity  |||  .
" we will not vote in favour of new measures , " he said at a  |||  meeting  |||  with the deputies of his new democracy party .
he declared his agreement with the objectives of reduction of the deficit and of the debt and of the struggle against waste , but also his opposition to any policy which would  |||  prevent  |||  economic recovery .
to olli rehn , the european commissioner responsible for economic and monetary affairs , who warned that the fmi and the eu would not unblock the loan of 8 thousand million euros  |||  required  |||  , without a written guarantee of all parties that they would support the planned measures , antonio samaras replied that his word was sufficient and that he would not sign anything under outside pressure .
it is necessary to legalise euthanasia and assisted  |||  suicide  |||  , says a committee of experts
regarding palliative medicine , the committee claims that governments , healthcare institutions and doctors work together to  |||  provide  |||  the best possible palliative care , apart from cancer cases .
|||  canadian  |||  society is half dead .
only 9 % of canadians agree to  |||  speak  |||  with their doctor when they want to die and take steps to that end .
this is one the conclusions of an imposing report by the royal society of canada , in which six experts in  |||  different  |||  fields took part , including ethics , the law and medicine .
and 86 % of them end by  |||  dying  |||  in hospital
countrywide , it is in quebec that the rate is highest , with 86 % of deaths taking place in  |||  hospital  |||  .
on the delicate question of euthanasia and assisted suicide , the authors of the report arrive at conclusions which oppose the position of the federal government , which has already said that it does not wish to change anything in the criminal code  |||  concerning  |||  euthanasia and assisted suicide .
now , according to the experts who also reviewed the position of all countries where these actions have been legalised or decriminalised , there is no proof that the aid decriminalisation involves abuses of  |||  application  |||  , that is to say , the practice of euthanasia , or of assisted suicide on persons who are not competent , or not consenting .
on the contrary , affirmed during a teleconference , jocelyn downie , who submitted the report , more such cases were found precisely in those countries , where euthanasia and assisted  |||  suicide  |||  have not been legalised .
" euthanasia is practised in canada , where it is clearly  |||  illegal  |||  . "
" assisted suicide is practised in canada , where it is clearly  |||  illegal  |||  , explains jocelyn downie .
canadians in favour of  |||  euthanasia  |||
it should be remembered that 85 % of canadians are in favour of euthanasia , because according to an angus reid enquiry in 2010 , they  |||  believe  |||  that it would allow persons at the end of their lives to alleviate their suffering .
and the legalisation of euthanasia would not result in  |||  sending  |||  a message that the life of aged or handicapped persons had less value .
regarding persons who commit assisted  |||  suicide  |||  , investigations indicate that 41 % of such cases should not have been prosecuted .
|||  regarding  |||  the continuation , or the withdrawal of nursing care of a patient , the situation is less clear , say the authors of the report .
they also suggest among their other recommendations , that the penal code should state that legally valid withdrawal of nursing care is not  |||  criminal  |||  .
the committee of experts also requests that health professionals should be trained in the duty to  |||  respect  |||  a withdrawal of nursing care at the end of life without having to fear criminal prosecution .
regarding palliative care , the committee calls on governments , nursing institutions , and doctors to work together to  |||  provide  |||  the best possible palliative care and not only in cases of cancer .
lastly , concerning palliative sedation already widely used in canadian health institutions , the committee asks that it should be  |||  considered  |||  where it only serves to reduce physical pain , as does euthanasia and that it should be subject to the same procedures .
reservations of other  |||  experts  |||
certain experts in the field of the health - related legislation have already voiced reservations  |||  concerning  |||  the conclusions of the royal society of canada experts ' report .
me deschamps also stresses that the authors of the report  |||  appear  |||  to place the independence of the person above all other values which contribute to the fabric of society
he says that " in  |||  society  |||  there are signposts and constraints .
the specialist in health legislation , margaret somerville also expressed "  |||  strong  |||  opposition to the conclusions of the report , which she described as being " obviously pro - euthanasia . "
margaret somerville , who is herself a member of the royal society of canada , contests , in particular , the data of the report  |||  concerning  |||  abuses in certain countries where euthanasia and assisted suicide have been legalised as in the netherlands and in oregon .
|||  damascus  |||  denounces a " plot "
the partisans of bachar al-assad demonstrated yesterday in front of the offices of the ministry of  |||  foreign  |||  affairs .
diplomatic pressures intensified yesterday on the syria of bachar al-assad , who , with the  |||  support  |||  of russia , is resisting them and has denounced a " plot " against his country .
two days after the suspension of syria from membership of the arab league , the european union has reinforced its sanctions against damascus , whilst syria 's neighbours turkey and jordan , came out in  |||  favour  |||  of president assad 's departure .
king abdallah ii of jordan yesterday became the first arab leader to call on president bachar al-assad to relinquish  |||  power  |||  in syria , where some forty civilians and members of the armed forces of the regime were killed .
" if bachar had the interest of his country at heart , he would have to resign , but he would also have to create the  |||  necessary  |||  conditions for a new phase of the political life , said the king of jordan , a neighbouring country of syria , in a bbc interview .
for their part , the united states are congratulating themselves on the  |||  increased  |||  consensus against assad and the actions of the syrian regime following the decisions of the arab league and the european union .
during this time , 16 civilians and at least 19 members of the armed forces of the regime die in the area of deraa in the south of syria ,  |||  announced  |||  l'observatoire syrien des droits de l'homme ( osdh ) .
two other civilians died during exchanges of fire and  |||  heavy  |||  rifles at jobar in the besieged town of homs , according tot his ong .
during a press conference , the  |||  syrian  |||  foreign minister walid mouallem stated that the country was approaching the end of the crisis . "
he moreover reacted strongly against the decision of the  |||  arab  |||  league to suspend damascus which according to him represents a " dangerous step . "
the french foreign minister alain juppé also declared himself in favour to the dispatch of uno observers to  |||  help  |||  to protect civilians from repression by the regime , which according to him , is " paranoid . "
a new extraordinary meeting of the league is  |||  planned  |||  for tomorrow to debate the implementation of escape from the crisis decided on 2 november and foreseeing in particular , the withdrawal of armed forces from the towns in dispute and the liberation of arrested demonstrators .
the russian foreign minister , sergyey lavrov , yesterday described as " incorrect " the decision of the arab league , whilst china exhorted syria to implement the plan of emerging from the crisis , taking care not to  |||  support  |||  possible sanctions against damascus .

monti  |||  demands  |||  time from the markets and sacrifices from italians
the future head of the italian government , mario monti , has asked the markets for a little time to form his team and to implement a programme , which will involve " sacrifices , " in order to recover credibility  |||  lost  |||  over the last few months of the berlusconi government .
he will have to  |||  form  |||  a relatively moderate cabinet composed of technocrats from outside parliament .
" monti spoke about an important programme involving a lot of sacrifices , " said francesco nucara , a deputy of one of the  |||  numerous  |||  small parliamentary groups taking part in the discussions after meeting the prime minister - designate .
the president of the chamber or deputies , gianfranco fini , said that he would wait to learn if mario monti would ask parliament for a vote of confidence between now and friday , to ascertain whether the new government had enough  |||  support  |||  .
m.  |||  monti  |||  commented on the nervousness of the stockmarkets here , asking them for time .
in a " democracy , time is needed for the preparation of a government and a programme , he stressed , adding that he was  |||  certain  |||  that the markets would be patient and understanding . "
his appointment by the president was initially welcomed by the markets , but disquiet re - emerged , in particular after an unexpected  |||  fall  |||  in industrial production in eurozone in september .
the prime minister - designate had to form a team , most importantly comprising technocrats , even  |||  though  |||  he stressed that he would also like to include " politicians . "
the new government would have to last until 2013 , the  |||  date  |||  of the next election , he said .
according to the president of the chamber of deputies , gianfranco fini , the new  |||  government  |||  would secure the vote of confidence of parliament by friday .
m. monti undertook that once in office he would work hard to ensure that italy would once again  |||  become  |||  a protagonist in europe .
a spokesman for the european commissioner , olli rehn . stressed that " regardless of a new government , our diagnostic of the  |||  italian  |||  economy has not changed . "
the european union , being convinced that rome would not achieve its objective budget in 2013 despite the austerity plan  |||  adopted  |||  over recent months , has asked , in particular , for stringent new measures .
the italian " boss of bosses " emma marcegaglia , who will meet him on tuesday , has also insisted on the  |||  necessity  |||  of relaunching the economy , " because a country which does not have growth , cannot observe the parameters of deficit . "
the great  |||  unknown  |||  is the longevity of his team .
president napolitano would like to avoid an  |||  early  |||  election , because by april 2012 italy must place state debentures worth 200 thousand million euros .
a russian scientist , vycheslav danilenko , assisted iran to develop a detonator usable with a nuclear weapon , confirmed on monday an  |||  american  |||  agency specialising in the field of atomic hazard .
last week , aiea announced its  |||  serious  |||  disquiet concerning a " possible military dimension " of the iranian nuclear programme .
the  |||  economic  |||  difficulties of his company led him to contact the iranian embassy in ukraine in 1995 .
according to these figures , the total number of cases of violence against moslems moved from 107 in 2009 to 160 in 2010 , equal to an increase of 49 % , as against an increase of 13 % of cases of violence against catholics , a  |||  fall  |||  of 4 % of attacks on jews and a global increase of 14 % in anti - religious crimes .
" human rights first has long stressed that acts of violence against moslems , as well as all forms of hate crime , must be regarded as  |||  serious  |||  violations of human rights , " adds one of the managers of the organisation , paul legendre .
" the  |||  american  |||  government can and must do more to deal with his abuse , he adds , judging that this could be due to the editing of police reports on hate crimes . "
this legislation was passed after the death of martin luther king to punish acts of violence  |||  linked  |||  to race , colour of skin , religion , origin and now sexual orientation .
on monday , the microblog site twitter introduced changes in the presentation of its platform , to  |||  allow  |||  its users , in particular , to observe the activity of those whom they are monitoring , which makes its service resemble that of facebook .
this enables one to know if they cause messages to be  |||  monitored  |||  , if they subscribe new accounts , if they have favourite messages , etc.
this new twitter formula was tested " on a small percentage of users in august " before being broadcast to the  |||  entire  |||  network on monday , indicated a spokeswoman of twitter , carolyn penner to afp .
twitter , which has been  |||  known  |||  so far for being rather unintuitive , and for its use of somewhat esoteric terms ( rt for re - posting someone else 's message , #followfriday for recommending following other users ) , much to the delight of experienced users , is thus opening itself to a wider audience by offering a user experience closer to those of popular social networks facebook and google + .
on the network ,  |||  users  |||  debated this innovation via " tweets " on internet .
" the functionality activity will help me to monitor better certain elements of my twitter flow , "  |||  sent  |||  @dannykronstrom .

inscription of a budgetary " golden  |||  rule  |||  " in the constitution
the government of the great social democratic / christian democratic coalition in power in austria decided on tuesday to write a budgetary " golden rule " into the constitution , in  |||  order  |||  to reduce public deficits and so avoid a possible downgrading by rating agencies of austria 's sovereign credit rsting ( triple a ) .
it was the social - democratic chancellor his elf , werner faymann , who  |||  announced  |||  this decision at the end of a meeting of the council of ministers , with the austrian public debt at 74,6 % , much higher than the norm of a maximum of 60 % set by the treaty of maastricht , but below the public debt of countries like italy , greece or spain .
" if the solvency of austria had not fallen by a  |||  single  |||  notch , from aaa to aa + , we would have to pay three thousand million euros of interest more every year , " argued the vice - chancellor and christian democratic foreign minister , michael spindelegger .
austria thus complies with a request from the brussels summit of member - states of eurozone on 26 october ; the heads of state and government  |||  requested  |||  a reduction by the end of 2102 of public deficits and a return to balanced public accounts in the constitution or in a law to the same effect .
the dispositions adopted by the austrian government approach the " german model , " being the first european country to adopt this "  |||  rule  |||  . "
by 2017 , the public structural deficit must  |||  fall  |||  by 0.75 % of the pib ) and from 2017 , the structural public deficit of the austrian federal state must not exceed 0,35 % of pib in any year , whilst the länder , as well as communities , must submit balanced budgets .
the objective is that of making public debt fall below the 60 % criterion  |||  fixed  |||  by the treaty of maastricht by 2020/2021 .
" we would intervene as we did the last time , if we found  |||  excessive  |||  volatility in the rate of exchange of the yen , explained m. noda to the senate .
on tuesday , the yen rose to near historical levels , causing the  |||  japanese  |||  authorities to intervene on 31 october .
but the yen had risen regularly since then , stimulated by purchases by investors who regard it as a " shelter " in these uncertain times of worldwide  |||  economic  |||  slowdown and the debt crisis in europe .
on tuesday , the dollar fell below 77 yen and the euro fell under the symbolic bar of 105 yen ,  |||  close  |||  to levels which triggered the last intervention .
|||  prior  |||  to the financial crisis of 2008-2009 , the dollar was about 120 yen and the euro over 160 yen .
this rise of the  |||  japanese  |||  currency damages japanese exports , because it makes japanese products more expensive and reduces the value of income of japanese firms from abroad , when converted into the national currency .
" japan is fighting to reconstruct itself " since the earthquake and the tsunami on 11 march , which devastated the region of tohoku ( north - east ) ,  |||  stressed  |||  m. noda who fears that this rise of the yen does not kill the fragile embryonic recovery .
the world 's third biggest economic power has resumed growth in the third quarter -1 , 5 % compared with the previous quarter - for the first time for a year , thanks to a  |||  rise  |||  in exports and consumption of households affected by the catastrophe .
but the prime minister felt that the high price of the yen did to reflect " japan 's  |||  economic  |||  fundamentals . "
since its last meeting at the end of october , the issuing institution  |||  increased  |||  by 5.000 million yen ( 47 thousand million euro 's ) worth of treasury bond purchases , raising the ceiling to 55.000 thousand million yen ( 519 thousand million euros ) , which it is devoting to the purchase of various financial securities to flood the liquidity market .
|||  eurozone  |||  :
the risk of contagion of the  |||  debt  |||  crisis is undermining european indices .
despite the appointment of new heads of government in greece and in italy and better growth figures in france and in germany , the rates in fragile countries continue to  |||  rise  |||  .
still worried about the stability of eurozone ,  |||  european  |||  exchanges have entered a little further into the negative area on this tuesday 15 november .
in paris , at 10 a.m. , the cac 40  |||  lost  |||  1,4 % to end at 3.064 points .
the dax at frankfurt fell 0,4 % and  |||  london  |||  0,1 % .
" with the new tensions about the yield of loans of eurozone states in  |||  difficulties  |||  , the share markets worldwide contimue to lose a part of their recent gains . "
" nervous investors are only too  |||  aware  |||  of the risk of contagion , " explains terry pratt , an institutional broker at ig markets quoted by reuter .
the tokyo exchange closed with a  |||  fall  |||  of 0,7 % , suffering fresh doubts of market participants on the subject of the capacity of europe to contain the debt crisis .
" japan , like the rest of the world has its eyes riveted on europe and the exchanges will chase one another in a corridor of  |||  narrow  |||  variations as investors will not have proof that the situation has stabilised , " states mitsushige akino , fund manager at ichiyoshi investment management .
this re - emergence of disquiet about the future of eurozone penalises the single currency , which has continued to  |||  fall  |||  on tuesday .
towards 10 a.m. the european currency is  |||  worth  |||  1,3570 dollars , having fallen by 0,4 % .
according to brokers , it fell after the party of the chancellor angela merkel , the cdu meeting on monday  |||  adopted  |||  a motion , envisaging , in particular , the possibility of a country in difficulty leaving the eurozone without also leaving the european union .
|||  italian  |||  and spanish rates substantially above 6 %
the borrowing rates of italy and spain  |||  remain  |||  at very disquieting levels .
this tuesday morning the yield of  |||  italian  |||  10 - year debentures attained 6,85 % , that of spanish ones of the same maturity date , 6,2 % .
these tensions of the rates of interest of southern  |||  countries  |||  , but also france , continue to feed the apprehensions of participants .
the head of the future italian government , mario monti asked the markets for time to restore the situation in an italy  |||  threatened  |||  by asphyxia by the weight of its debt .
the new greek  |||  prime minister  |||  lucas papademos affirmed that the implementation of decisions taken at the eurozone summit on 27 october would be " the principal task " of his government .
the spread of the  |||  rate  |||  between 10 - year german and spanish bonds has reached a new historically high level .
the inseen nevertheless revised downwards the figure for the second quarter , with a  |||  fall  |||  of 0,1 % of the gross internal product ( pib ) instead of stagnation .
and it is really the fourth quarter , which most disquiets the  |||  economists  |||  .
germany for its  |||  part  |||  , ha recorded a growth of 0,5 % for the same period .
|||  energy  |||  policy :
facts must  |||  prevail  |||  over dogmas
if there is a topic which cannot be dealt with via short - term considerations , or under the stress of emotion , it is  |||  energy  |||  policy .
the availability and  |||  cost  |||  of electricity affect directly the purchasing power and the competitiveness of companies .
the debate will not be fruitful , unless it explores all the  |||  economic  |||  , social and environmental consequences of the proposed options .
the french must  |||  base  |||  their opinion on the objective facts of rational data .
during the same period , it will become necessary to palliate the increasing shortage of fossil resources in order to continue to  |||  produce  |||  electricity permanently without forgetting the overriding need to reduce the emissions of greenhouse gases to fight climatic imbalance , a subject which has vanished from the ecological debate .
the fukushima  |||  accident  |||  does not modify any of these parameters .
this is why germany is isolated in its decision to renounce nuclear  |||  energy  |||  .
this is not the case of belgium , which subordinates its decision to the need to find a source able to replace nuclear energy , or that of switzerland , which intends to  |||  build  |||  only the most modern ones .
although the  |||  german  |||  model based on renewable energies is sometimes quoted as an example , the reality contradicts that argument .
the choice of berlin will result in a rise of the price of electricity , an  |||  increased  |||  energy dependence aggravated by increased recourse to imported gas , in particular from russia , a jump in carbon dioxide emissions due to the construction of gas and of coal centres .
in a few months all these adverse  |||  effects  |||  will already be felt .
the case of  |||  denmark  |||  should be considered .
champion of europe in the construction of turbines , from which it draws 30 % of its electricity , it is also one of the largest users of coal and of gas due to intermittent wind ; due to which its carbon dioxide emissions and the price of its electricity are respectively 65 % and 50 % higher than the european  |||  average  |||  .
on the other hand , thanks to the constancy of energy policy , our neighbours pay 40 % more for their electricity than  |||  french  |||  households .
due to this , any  |||  significant  |||  fall in the cost of nuclear energy would bring about a big rise of cost of electricity , which would render illusory the fine declarations on re - industrialisation of our country and the protection of purchasing power .
a price , which a large majority of the  |||  french  |||  refuse to pay , all the more so , since they do not object to this form of energy in principle .
to solve the  |||  energy  |||  equation , it must be admitted that there is no miraculous or diabolical source of production of electricity .
the development by areva of low carbon dioxide emission solutions , nuclear and renewable , bears witness to the complementary nature sources of  |||  energy  |||  .
in france , we have a safety  |||  authority  |||  , which exercises an intransigent and transparent control of existing generation centres such as flamanville .
our teams , whose professionalism is  |||  recognised  |||  , are accustomed to the same safety - related obsession .
in a space of 50 years , the nuclear industry has experienced three  |||  serious  |||  incidents .
only one , three mile island , occurred under normal  |||  operating  |||  conditions , but without any human or environmental consequences .
at tchernobyl , the design of the reactor and unforgivable human  |||  error  |||  brought about the drama .
at fukushima , some people appear to forget that the accident resulted from two natural disasters of unprecedented magnitude , which  |||  caused  |||  the death of tens of thousands of people .
the nuclear industry will draw lessons from this  |||  accident  |||  , as it has from its two predecessors .
the fruit of this step and of cooperation between safety authorities , the operators and  |||  french  |||  and german constructors , the epr presents a design enabling it to resist such phenomena .
since it is being considered by all electricians wishing to construct a generation centre , a decision to construct it at flamanville would be a magnificent gift to the competitors of areva and edf by clearing their way to seizing the leadership of the unavoidable  |||  development  |||  of nuclear energy .
it is essential and legitimate to  |||  look  |||  for the best fan of energies for our country , but it would be irresponsible to allow emotion , dogmas and partisan manoeuvres to dominate the debate , which is so decisive for the economic , social and financial situation of our country .
is immigration a burden or an opportunity for the  |||  economy  |||  ?
immigration policy under nicolas sarkozy was criticised from various aspects a congestion of police , legal and administrative services subjected to a policy of numbers and the compatibility of that policy with the self - proclaimed status of the country as the country of  |||  french  |||  human rights .
more recently , it is administrative harassment of foreign students , which is topical , with the  |||  minister  |||  of the interior ( " libération " on 23 may ) declaring that france " does not need foreign talent , bricklayers and waiters . "
but it is only rarely analysed from the  |||  economic  |||  viewpoint .
there is a lot of consensus between the  |||  left  |||  and the right on this subject .
on the right , the tone was set by jacques chirac , who declared in 1976 that " 900,000 unemployed would not become a problem in a country with 2 million of foreign workers , " and on the  |||  left  |||  by michel rocard explaining in 1990 that france " cannot accommodate all the world 's misery . "
the only  |||  difference  |||  , the degree of generosity
in 2005 , the fear of invasion of the national territory by hordes of polish plumbers was felt both on the  |||  left  |||  and on the right .
both sides see immigrants as a burden on the french economy and on  |||  french  |||  society .
the only difference resides in the degree of generosity , which one deigns to  |||  grant  |||  to immigrants .
this notion of immigration being a burden and a problem , may be an electoral asset , but it is economically very  |||  costly  |||  .
as the economists ian goldin and geoffrey cameron , remind us in a recent book summarising the most recent  |||  knowledge  |||  of immigration ( exceptional people : how migration shaped our world and will define our future , mai 2011 , princeton university press , 352 pp . ) , there is wide consensus among specialists on the positive impact of migration flows on economic growth , wages and employment in countries , which admit immigrants .
restraining immigration leads to anaemic growth and harms  |||  employment  |||  .
fears about the impact of immigrants are  |||  based  |||  on the notion that they are liable to replace native workers , in particular unskilled ones , exerting downward pressure on wages .
unskilled immigrants work in sectors , which do not attract local labour and the most highly skilled ones in dynamic sectors where  |||  training  |||  does is not linked to offers of employment .
a positive  |||  effect  |||  on wages
giovanni peri has calculated that a  |||  rise  |||  of 1 % in the migratory flow causes an increase of between 0,6 and 0,9 % in real long - term pay .
and does so without taking into account the fact that the diversity contributed by immigrants contributes to the creation of ideas and to economic growth ( a  |||  large  |||  proportion of naturalised immigrants are among american nobel prizewinners , whilst google , intel , paypal , ebay and yahoo were all founded by immigrants ) .
migrants are also net contributors to social systems , averaging 1 % of the  |||  total  |||  budgets of european countries .
th world labour organisation estimates that for example in germany , an immigrant arriving at the age of 30 , will make a net  |||  contribution  |||  ( receipts less expenditure ) of an average of 150,000 euros to public budgets during his lifetime .
nicolas sarkozy wished at the  |||  start  |||  of his mandate to look for missing points of growth " with the teeth . "
the teeth in question , intended to serve to dissuade immigrants , had precisely the opposite  |||  effect  |||  .
europe invented democracy , thinks in terms of  |||  european  |||  democracy
democracy is a  |||  precious  |||  possession ; it is also a fragile one .
the european continent should be able to  |||  remember  |||  that having invented it in athens over two thousand years ago , it experienced during the xxth century the tragedies of the world war , of totalitarisms , the holocaust , the gulag , but also franco in spain , salazar in portugal and the colonels in greece .
some believed that it was  |||  enough  |||  for democracy to finally triumph over its enemies , to exercise the vote , and to do so as directly as possible .
universal suffrage , in order to be the sine qua non of democracy , is not enough and can actually  |||  become  |||  a " tool of oppression " as once said the republican philosopher etienne vacherot .
no , democracy requires a lot more , a public space , a public spirit , values , an organisation , a separation and control of powers , education , the lumieres ,  |||  economic  |||  and social solidarity , justice .
the european crisis , which we are passing through , is an economic crisis , but it is primarily a  |||  political  |||  crisis and a crisis of democracy .
in this respect , the palinode of a true - false greek referendum will have a  |||  double  |||  revelatory value , that of a need of a powerful reversal of policy , but also that of the worrying sentiment of its impossibility and of its incongruity .
the truth is that the  |||  lines  |||  of the forefront of democratic struggle have now moved , and that for many , the republican soldiers are no longer firing in the right direction .
the " free hand " of an absolute european monarch , or a jump with tied feet into the  |||  nationalist  |||  void ; what a choice for a citizen !
no , we do not want the blades of a guillotine , but an  |||  exercise  |||  , joint , serene and ongoing , of choice and of democracy , this time on european level .
there are no crises in greece , italy , spain or portugal and one would not know where to  |||  stop  |||  enumerating them , because there is only a single crisis and that is in europe .
it is the  |||  whole  |||  of europe , which defers to the dictates of the markets and of rating agencies , who suffer from their incapacity and a lack of solidarity .
it is all  |||  europe  |||  , which is humiliated on the international scene .
there is disquiet about the  |||  transfer  |||  of sovereignty to europe , but it is the entire europe , which is gradually losing its sovereignty , and with its each of its nations .
the urgency concerns the  |||  return  |||  to popular sovereignty , the direction of the european project .
because it is by all working together , that europeans will be able  |||  reduce  |||  the weight of their individual debts , to free themselves from the markets and to prepare for the future by investing in it .
emerging from the crisis will entail decisions on european level , which cannot be made without  |||  total  |||  democratic legitimacy without leading us into disaster .
after having  |||  long  |||  fought this proposal by specialists and of jacques delors , the whole world now calls for a european economic government .
but the idea without stronger economic , political and  |||  democratic  |||  integration and lived in such by citizens , would be a fresh folly and a new impasse .
we must launch a new stage of european  |||  construction  |||  .
the revolution of  |||  interests  |||  would not be enough .
this lesson remains  |||  valid  |||  .
we must construct a europe integrated on  |||  economic  |||  level .
this can only be done by constructing a more  |||  democratic  |||  europe on political level , a real popular european sovereignty .
to make  |||  europe  |||  , let us make europeans .
the  |||  worldwide  |||  chip map room opens on tuesday at villepinte near paris , in an optimistic atmosphere .
this year , 460 million of contactless chip cards should be  |||  sold  |||  worldwide , as against 320 millions a year earlier !
their  |||  share  |||  will progress in 2012 ( 580 million units expected ) and represent almost 10 % of the global market of chip cards ( 6,925 million cards ) .
for a  |||  long  |||  time , lagging behind the asia - pacific region , europe is now gaining ground in contactless payment .
some 26 million visa bank cards are already equipped with this functionality and 75 000 payment terminals  |||  accept  |||  them .
this year , carrefour  |||  issued  |||  2,5 million contactless mastercards .
to achieve higher speeds , it is now necessary to equip their  |||  clients  |||  .
" two  |||  large  |||  french establishments have undertaken to distribute systematically in future to their clients , bank cards equipped for contactless use , announces gérard nébouy , director - general of visa europe france .
few apparatus are at present equipped with nfc technology ( near field communication , essential for  |||  implementing  |||  these transactions .
" but they should really take wing  |||  next  |||  year . "
" we are counting on a  |||  worldwide  |||  sale of 80 to 120 million units in 2012 , explains marc bertin , president of eurosmart .
the iphones of some 200 clients and collaborators are going to be  |||  equipped  |||  to authorise contactless payment .
the bpce has a  |||  similar  |||  project in strasbourg and in marseille .
the terrorist  |||  front  |||  extends from sahara to nigeria
paris is disquieted by links between the  |||  islamic  |||  maghreb and the boko haram sect .
suspected for a long time , the links between the terrorist group al-qaida in the islamic maghreb ( aqmi ) and the nigerian boko haram sect have been  |||  confirmed  |||  .
on sunday , the algerian deputy foreign minister , abdelkader messahel , even stated that algiers is now  |||  certain  |||  .
" the manner in which the two organisations operate and the reports of secret services  |||  show  |||  that there is a lot of cooperation , he explained without elaborating .
paris  |||  appears  |||  to make a similar analysis .
the inquiry into the  |||  kidnapping  |||  of two frenchmen in niger in january discovered two bridges .
the men kidnapped men in a restaurant in niamey by relatives of aqui , antoine de léocour and vincent delory had to be  |||  killed  |||  on the next day at the same time as several of their kidnappers during an operation launched by special french forces .
among the rubble left behind by the  |||  action  |||  , french and nigerian investigators found several telephone chips belonging to the terrorists .
|||  terrorist  |||  axis
the analysis of  |||  calls  |||  exchanged indicates several interlocutors based in mali , in niger and in nigeria .
according to radio france internationale ( rfi ) , two numbers interest the investigators in particular ; one leads to a nigerian who lived for a long time in maiduguri , a town in northern nigeria , the cradle of boko haram and the other to a man said to be  |||  close  |||  to aqmi and to the sect .
" this is an advance , but it is undoubtedly  |||  necessary  |||  to await more exact proofs before talking about operational cooperation between aqmi and boko haram . "
" but it is  |||  possible  |||  . "
" it has been  |||  known  |||  for years that the sect benefits from outside financial and intellectual support and that it is becoming more and more active , says kunle amuwo , a nigerian researcher .
in recent months , this support became more and more evident from the developments and statements by boko haram and from its methods of operation , which increasingly  |||  include  |||  resort to kamikazes and to increasingly complex explosive engines of the same type as those used by aqmi .
|||  rapid  |||  success
founded in 2002 at maiduguri around a mosque , a  |||  school  |||  and a fundamentalist imam mohammed yusuf , boko haram - which means in hausa " with western education " is a criminal , who promotes the installation of an islamic emirate in the moslem north of nigeria .
in this  |||  poor  |||  region , the association is enjoying rapid success .
it is politicised and demands rigid  |||  respect  |||  of sharia , whilst its militants engage in a struggle with the impious central government .
the  |||  latter  |||  target primarily churches , bars and administrations .
in 2009 , the militants of boko haram showed themselves particularly active , multiplying attacks on  |||  police  |||  establishments .
the army surrounds a  |||  town  |||  and leaves 800 dead behind .
mohammed yusuf , arrested alive , was  |||  killed  |||  in prison .
now the sect will become radicalised and will  |||  leave  |||  its northern fiefs .
in august , the local united nations headquarters will be its first international  |||  target  |||  .
the creation of a  |||  terrorist  |||  axis in africa , which will move from mauritania to somalia via nigeria , now disquiets all security specialists .
now that aqmi has invested mali and niger and the somalis of al-chebab operate in kenya , boko haram  |||  appears  |||  to be a new menace in the continent .
the world according to the republican presidential  |||  candidates  |||
can an america weakened by crisis , lead a complex world by  |||  simple  |||  and indeed , simplistic , ideas ?
to listen to republican presidential candidates , the electors might  |||  believe  |||  it .
so much the worse if this should trigger a  |||  trade  |||  war , he said .
jon huntsman , obama 's  |||  former  |||  ambassador to china and the only candidate with a vision of a sophisticated foreign policy , has failed to suppress an attitude which flatters the emotions .
he called for a muscular , but a constructive , dialogue with peking ( the current  |||  position  |||  of obama ) .
in the style of  |||  reagan  |||
romney also  |||  promised  |||  military strikes on iran , if sanctions failed to stop its nuclear programme .
" if i am  |||  elected  |||  , i will stop iran , he trumpeted . "
" if obama is re -  |||  elected  |||  , they will have the bomb . "
recently , he called for opposition to the chinese military threat , because peking is  |||  trying  |||  to develop a nuclear capacity - apparently unaware of the fact that china has possessed it since 1964 !
the texas governor rick perry , who supports israel and wants military strikes against iran , says that he is ready to involve the usa army in mexico against the  |||  drug  |||  cartels .
resort to the torture of terrorist suspects prohibited by obama in 2009 , is also  |||  recommended  |||  by cain , perry and by the candidate michele bachmann .
one is far away from the 2008 republican  |||  candidate  |||  john mccain , a foreign policy heavyweight .
the opponents of the current president reply that reagan also had  |||  simple  |||  ideas and that he won the cold war .
they recall that obama himself was an amateur and that he had to water down his wine  |||  concerning  |||  anti - terrorism .
they insist with good reason on the setback of his naive dialogue with iran on the premature departure of the " boys " from iraq , his tergiversations in libya labelling him  |||  weak  |||  .
the population judges as positive obama 's the balance of  |||  national  |||  security , which eliminated bin laden .
since iraq , it distrusts  |||  military  |||  interventions , which run into quicksands .
and in arguing that it is  |||  necessary  |||  to reconstruct america economically to revive its leadership , obama is right .
the north stream , a new portal for the entry of  |||  russian  |||  gas into europe
the north stream gasduct connecting western europe and russia directly along the bottom of the  |||  baltic  |||  sea , has been commissioned .
it is scheduled to  |||  supply  |||  gas for the equivalent of 30 million homes .
gazprom , the giant  |||  russian  |||  gas producer , wanted to celebrate the event with a " bang . "
over 500 guests including four heads of state and of government took part  |||  last  |||  tuesday on the shores of the baltic , between an orchestral performance and a fine buffet , in the inauguration of north stream , the new gasduct , which directly links russia and germany under the sea .
symbolically , the german chancellor angela merkel , the russian president dmitri medvedev , the french prime minister françois fillon and his  |||  dutch  |||  opposite number mark rutte jointly turned the valve controlling the entry of russian gas into the west european network .
with this new gasduct , 27,5 thousand million additional cubic metres of russian gas will arrive every year in western europe via a first pipeline of 1 224 km linking the region of saint petersburg to the  |||  land  |||  of mecklemburg - pomerania .
a second pipeline is due to be ready by the end of 2012 , making it possible to  |||  deliver  |||  a total of 55 thousand million cubic metres of gas , the equivalent of the entire french consumption .
and the possibility of constructing a  |||  third  |||  pipeline of the same course is already under discussion .
for gazprom , the completion on time of this  |||  huge  |||  project is a victory .
the north stream will in fact  |||  allow  |||  gas to be delivered directly to germany , avoiding any passage via a third country ( poland or the ukraine ) .
that is to say that the topic is politically  |||  sensitive  |||  .
but at the price of depriving europe of  |||  energy  |||  , since the project has created a breach between eastern and western europe .
russia has succeeded in less than five years , in achieving its vision of a direct alliance between russia and the the rich western countries , which consume  |||  large  |||  quantities of gas , and whose deposits are declining .
" this gasduct is a component of partnership with russia , it is a new artery which links us organically , " confirmed françois fillon inaugurating the gasduct , demonstrating to what extent  |||  large  |||  gas contracts are both politically and economically important .
all this explains the broad smiles on the faces of the heads of gazprom ,  |||  present  |||  in large numbers at lubmin , the point of arrival of the gas .
the construction of this gasduct is also a  |||  technical  |||  exploit .
the undersea  |||  pipeline  |||  is made of steel embedded in concrete , in order to protect it from ships ' anchors .
ir rests on the  |||  bottom  |||  of the sea , at an average depth of 200 metres .
to construct it , it was  |||  necessary  |||  to avoid minefields dating back to the second world war .
" a hundred had to be removed or  |||  destroyed  |||  as a precaution , " says jens müller , spokesman of north stream company .
it was also necessary to multiply steps of  |||  protecting  |||  the fauna and the flora .
the pipeline is a  |||  long  |||  metal serpent , of weight equivalent to that of 242 eiffel towers , with no breaks throughout its length , no valves and no maintenance stations .
" in case of accident we  |||  stop  |||  the passage of gas for at least one minute , " states jens müller .
the  |||  surveillance  |||  of the state of the gasduct is provided by an undersea robot , pulled by a ship for outside observation , as well as by an apparatus circulating within the gasduct .
being cigar - shaped , it is  |||  introduced  |||  inside the 1 - metre wide pipeline , and it is pushed along by the gas .
the gasduct was  |||  designed  |||  to work for 50 years without any need for even the smallest repair .
the gas circulation is implemented  |||  simply  |||  by its pressure .
five companies combined their forces to  |||  implement  |||  this project .
the leader  |||  remains  |||  gazprom , which holds 51 % of the shareholding .
the others are the german companies e. on and basf ( 15.5 % each ) and the  |||  dutch  |||  gasunie and the french group gdf suez ( 9 % each ) .
these five companies have created a  |||  joint  |||  enterprise called north stream , delegated to construct and to operate the gasduct .
it has its headquarters at zug in switzerland , where taxation is particularly  |||  favourable  |||  .
" gazprom will pay for the  |||  total  |||  capacity , whatever may be the quantity of gas actually transported , " states jens müller .
the financing of the construction of the gasduct was provided to the extent of 30 % by the shareholders and of 70 % by  |||  bank  |||  loans .
the total  |||  cost  |||  of the works will be 7.4 thousand million euros for the two pipelines .
the gdf suez  |||  investment  |||  will be about 240 millions .
but the minority shareholders are  |||  certain  |||  to recover their costs , since gazprom assumes the entire risk .
4.5 metre  |||  high  |||  valves form the gas exit .
sensors measure pressure , temperature and the specific gravities of arriving gas before being transferred into  |||  german  |||  gasducts .
since  |||  last  |||  tuesday , the terminal has been receiving one million cubic metres of russian gas every hour .
at  |||  full  |||  capacity , this will be 3 million an hour and in 2012 , 6 million .
created fifteen years ago by an  |||  italian  |||  company , moleskine will restore the taste of writing .
it is a scent of adventure , of hours sent in writing by a the  |||  light  |||  of a candle .
the moleskine notebook is easily recognised , by its  |||  black  |||  rectangular cover , its elastic , its broken white pages , as if aged over time .
the italian company modo modo , based in milan ,  |||  decided  |||  to launch a designer notebook .
this type of notebook is said to be  |||  highly  |||  prized by writers and travellers .
|||  success  |||  is there .
one has travelled far from the  |||  production  |||  of the first years , when only 3000 notebooks were made .
moleskine is crossing the  |||  italian  |||  frontiers and is exporting to 70 countries , from france to the usa .
it is difficult to  |||  establish  |||  a profile of the typical purchaser , because the notebook attracts equally a businessman , a student and a professional .
moleskine consumers are cosmopolitan ,  |||  open  |||  - minded and cultivated .
" we  |||  followed  |||  the spirit of the times and this need for new means of writing , notwithstanding the rise of e-mail , " explains maria sebregondi .
this cultural signature accompanies the  |||  development  |||  of moleskine ; recently , the brand launched an exhibition " detour " where architects or artists exhibit their own notebook .
in august , it also launched a leopardskin pattern cover on the  |||  occasion  |||  of the film festival in locarno .
exploiting its success and the cultural aura , moleskine diversified its  |||  products  |||  to include handbags , pens , computer bags . the brand includes every kind of support .
a success , which aroused envy ; in the autumn of 2006 , modo modo was bought by the investment fund sg  |||  capital  |||  europe , now syntegra capital , to write a new page in the history of moleskine .
why is the rate of unemployment of handicapped  |||  workers  |||  so high ?
some 19 % of handicapped  |||  persons  |||  are looking for work .
the 15th week for the  |||  employment  |||  of the handicapped starts today .
" the progress  |||  achieved  |||  since 15 years ago is considerable . "
" at that time the rate of unemployment was not 2x but 3x as  |||  high  |||  . "
it must be said that for the handicapped , the obstacles to obtaining  |||  employment  |||  are still many .
they are rather old : 37 % are over 50 ( 17 % on  |||  average  |||  ) .
lastly , long - term unemployment is very  |||  widespread  |||  , being 85 % for the handicapped versus 38 % on an average .
briefly , all these are criteria which greatly complicate a return to employment and which constitute the nub of the problem , " according to christian grapin , director -  |||  general  |||  of tremplin , an association created in 1992 to help companies to recruit handicapped workers .
here are some of the  |||  brakes  |||  .
it is hardly necessary to speak about mentalities , which do change , but too  |||  slowly  |||  .
a study carried out in april by the association ims - entreprendre pour la cité showed that the managers questioned had a low level of  |||  knowledge  |||  of handicap , " with an " over - representation of persons in wheelchairs , psychically or intellectually deficient persons . "
the latter known  |||  figures  |||  dating to 2008 have a ratio of 2.6 % .
proof : the number of " taxed " establishments , like the sums  |||  paid  |||  , have fallen between 2007 and 2011 , from 59 000 to 46 000 structures ( and from 606 to 480 million euros ) .
" the law of 2005 , which  |||  raised  |||  the contributions , created a strong pressure on companies , explains pierre blanc . "
according to the ministry of employment , only 59 % of establishments employing between 20 and 49 handicapped persons , versus 82 % of  |||  companies  |||  employing between 100 and 199 persons .
before facing the blues on tuesday evening ( 20.45 hrs ) eden hazard and georges leekens did not hide the pleasure , which this  |||  friendly  |||  match gave to them .
we do not go so far as to say that there was connivance between them , but the  |||  image  |||  is symbolic .
" i am very  |||  pleased  |||  with eden , his progress and the fact that he is belgian . "
in contrast between his respective club and selection performances , " it is of a piece if it is  |||  justified  |||  . "
" at lille , i am there all the year round , which is not the  |||  case  |||  of belgium . "
selected to play against romania on friday evening in its match against france , hazard went to saint - denis in order at  |||  last  |||  to " shine . "
he encouraged the blues from the age of 7  |||  years  |||  and the victorious campaigns of 1998 and 2000 .
this necessarily participates in strengthening even more the  |||  particular  |||  character of this match .
all the more so , since opposite are  |||  mathieu  |||  ( debuchy ) , yohan ( cabaye ) and adil ( rami ) , " he recalls .
" to be able to  |||  play  |||  against them , that is pure happiness ! "
with bonhomie , leekens recalled "  |||  pride  |||  . "
" pride " of playing in " a gala  |||  match  |||  . "
" pride " also in inding ass " neighbour " that france has " become again a very high level team " only a  |||  little  |||  more than one year after the trauma of knysna .
"  |||  laurent  |||  blanc was a thunderbolt , he enthuses .
now that belgium will miss the  |||  next  |||  euro , the technician will share an aircraft with the blues management ... brazil in 2014 .
" our  |||  little  |||  belgians become big , " he stressed .
" one is  |||  building  |||  something , the players are ambitious , they are hungry . "
the portugal of paulo bento starts its return match against bosnia ( 22h00 ) very optimistically , this tuesday in  |||  lisbon  |||  .
on their way there , both teams appeared to lack  |||  realism  |||  .
" at the end of these 90 minutes , we will be a happy  |||  team  |||  and most importantly , a happy country . "
paulo bento already  |||  sees  |||  himself in poland and in the ukraine .
for him there is not a shadow of a  |||  doubt  |||  , the selection , with which he has been at odds since september 2010 , will qualify for euro 2012 .
|||  portugal  |||  is only 90 minutes away from happiness .
in view of the ( 0-0 ) , on friday in the hell of zenica it is  |||  clear  |||  that the games are not over .
" it is a good  |||  result  |||  , which nevertheless involves a certain risk "
but on their side , in their illuminated stade de la luz in lisbon , the  |||  portuguese  |||  are convinced that they are playing in front of a public which must be enthusiastic , even if the match is very close , " said an optimistic , but lucid , bento
" we are expecting a very close match , but we are convinced that we can win ,  |||  declared  |||  the portuguese trainer aged 42 .
" we  |||  continue  |||  to have a 50 % chance of being at euro 2012 , " even under the successor of carlos queiroz .
" it is a good  |||  result  |||  , which nevertheless carries some risk , regrets bento .
" we are going to play a team which has many technical qualities and which has players possessing many  |||  individual  |||  qualities , " he added .
as already in zenica , the portuguese would plan to exert maximal pressure on the bosnians from the  |||  start  |||  , to " give them no time to think . "
a good idea ,  |||  provided  |||  that it will , prove realistic this time .
a  |||  republican  |||  strategy to counter the re - election of obama
republican  |||  leaders  |||  justified their policy by the need to combat electoral fraud .
|||  indeed  |||  , republican lawyers identified only 300 cases of electoral fraud in the united states in a decade .
one thing is certain : these new provisions will have a negative impact on voter  |||  turn  |||  - out .
in this sense , the measures will partially undermine the  |||  american  |||  democratic system .
unlike in canada , the american states are  |||  responsible  |||  for the organisation of federal elections in the united states .
it is in this spirit that a majority of  |||  american  |||  governments have passed new laws since 2009 making the registration or voting process more difficult .
as a result , 180 bills restricting the exercise of the  |||  right  |||  to vote in 41 states were introduced in 2011 alone .
the new election laws  |||  require  |||  voters to show a photo id card and proof of us citizenship .
before the 2006 elections , no us  |||  state  |||  required voters to show a photo id card .
in 2008 , the supreme court of the  |||  united  |||  states upheld the constitutionality of the indiana law .
over the past two years , they sponsored bills in 34 states to  |||  force  |||  voters to show a photo id card .
it is important to  |||  note  |||  that , unlike quebec , american citizens do not have a universal id card such as the health insurance card .
in fact , 11 % of  |||  american  |||  citizens , i.e. 21 million people of voting age , do not possess a photo id card issued by a government agency of their state .
in addition , five million new  |||  voters  |||  in 2012 do not have such identification .
and it often costs over a hundred dollars to obtain the  |||  required  |||  identity card .
the new restrictions disproportionately  |||  affect  |||  young people , minorities and people with low incomes .
in fact , 25 % of african americans , 15 % of those earning less than $ 35,000 ; 18 % of citizens over 65 and 20 % of voters 18 to 29 years old do not have the  |||  required  |||  photo id card .
on the other hand , these same states  |||  allow  |||  fishing or hunting club members , who vote more republican , to use the cards issued by these clubs when they vote .
prior to 2004 , no  |||  state  |||  required proof of citizenship to vote .
since 2011 , a dozen states have  |||  adopted  |||  laws requiring voters to prove they are american citizens .
in addition , they limited the right of individuals and groups to  |||  provide  |||  assistance to voters wishing to register .
these restrictions are not without  |||  consequence  |||  .
for example , during the 2004  |||  general  |||  election , voter registration campaigns contributed to registering around 10 million citizens .
however , the measures  |||  adopted  |||  since 2009 have led to a 17 % drop in the registration rate of new voters in 2010 compared to 2006 .
in addition , republican legislators have enacted laws in five other states  |||  aimed  |||  at reducing the early voting period .
for example , during the 2008  |||  general  |||  election in florida , 33 % of early voters were african - americans , who accounted however for only 13 % of voters in the state .
of course , democratic legislators and their  |||  supporters  |||  vigorously opposed the adoption of laws restricting voter registration .
several bills were blocked by vetoes of  |||  democratic  |||  governors .
the united states attorney  |||  general  |||  intervened to suspend the most controversial laws .
they were able to partially  |||  limit  |||  the damage .
for example , only 16 out of 34 states have  |||  adopted  |||  laws requiring the presentation of a photo id card .
however , the new rules put in place will undoubtedly make it more difficult to exercise the  |||  right  |||  to vote in 2012 .
a 2011 brennan centre report shows that the states that have  |||  adopted  |||  these laws represent 171 of the 270 votes needed in the electoral college to win the presidency .
it is too early to say with certainty that these legislative changes in the electoral system will have  |||  significant  |||  impacts on the outcome of the 2012 presidential elections .
in this sense , the measures will partially undermine the  |||  american  |||  democratic system .
indeed , the psa  |||  test  |||  sometimes shows erroneous results with false negative or even false positive results , which involve unnecessary medical interventions .
we asked two specialists for their  |||  opinion  |||  .
the key is to make the right decision once  |||  cancer  |||  has been detected .
the patient really needs to be made to understand the degree of risk of his cancer , by  |||  offering  |||  him the options available , not necessarily treating prostate cancers that are not long - term life threatening , and opting instead , in such cases , for active monitoring of the disease .
today , many men in  |||  whom  |||  cancer has been detected will not be treated because their cancer is not aggressive and is not life threatening .
more and more , specific criteria are being determined in order to decide who should or should not be  |||  treated  |||  .
therefore i  |||  recommend  |||  taking the test .
in collaboration with the société internationale d'urologie [ siu ] , movember has  |||  created  |||  a tool that makes it possible to evaluate the pros and cons of the psa test .

preventing the  |||  disease  |||
unfortunately , there is no miracle recipe for  |||  preventing  |||  cancer .
despite the progress in research , the adoption of healthy  |||  living  |||  habits remains the best way to reduce the risk of suffering from it .
it is estimated that if everyone ate well and exercised  |||  enough  |||  , 30 % of cancers could be prevented .
" if no more people smoked , this rate would increase to at least 50 % , " says andré beaulieu , spokesman for the  |||  canadian  |||  cancer society .
on the other hand , it is  |||  estimated  |||  that roughly 10 % of cancers are hereditary .
some are also  |||  completely  |||  unexplained .
cigarettes are linked to 85 % of lung  |||  cancer  |||  cases .
it is also a risk factor for a number of  |||  others  |||  .
this massively damages people 's  |||  health  |||  .
" even today , there are 1.5 million  |||  smokers  |||  in quebec " deplores spokesperson andré beaulieu .
|||  encouraging  |||  data : 10 years after giving up smoking , the risk of dying from cancer drops by half .
|||  weight  |||
overweight and obesity are also conducive to the onset of the disease ,  |||  according  |||  to the scc .
they can  |||  increase  |||  the risks of cancer of the breast , colon and rectum , oesophagus , pancreas and uterus .
" research shows that the regular practice of physical activity  |||  throughout  |||  your life protects against colon cancer " it is also said .
the organisation also recommends  |||  limiting  |||  your consumption of red meat .
in large amounts , it increases the  |||  risks  |||  of developing colo - rectal cancer .
likewise , so do cured meat products , and these should be  |||  avoided  |||  .
the conservation of meat by smoking , drying or curing can cause the  |||  formation  |||  of carcinogens .
" they can damage cells in the body and  |||  lead  |||  to the development of cancer " it is explained .
for the time being however their  |||  research  |||  is inconclusive .
|||  studies  |||  on vitamin e are contradictory , according to the scc .
while one study noted a decrease in the risk of prostate cancer , another noted an  |||  increase  |||  .
also the  |||  effect  |||  of vitamin d on cancer is not clear .
indeed , it is believed that this boson is part of the mechanism  |||  responsible  |||  for the mass of everything in the universe , no less .
also it is the last particle whose existence is predicted by the standard model - our best or " less worse " explanation of the nature and behaviour of  |||  matter  |||  - but which has not yet been observed empirically .
we know without a shadow of a doubt that it is a new authentic particle , and greatly resembles the higgs boson predicted by the  |||  standard  |||  model .
in addition , new data unveiled this week at a large physics congress in kyoto seem to confirm this , but there are still insufficient data to be perfectly  |||  sure  |||  .
but let 's suppose that it really is the higgs , since the chances of being mistaken  |||  seem  |||  slim , and see what it is .
in our  |||  world  |||  , there is a fatally unavoidable law which states that two things cannot meet at the same place at the same time .
there 's no way to break this rule - and do n't try too  |||  hard  |||  , you 'll go mad .
however , even though particle physics is a very strange world , it turns out that it also has a law of the same kind : the pauli exclusion principle , which states that two particles cannot occupy the same space at the same time if they are in the same " quantum state " - this " state " consisting roughly of  |||  certain  |||  of their characteristics .
based on this , physicists classify particles into two  |||  categories  |||  .
in one corner we have good citizens called fermions , who wisely obey the pauli  |||  principle  |||  .
while lurking in the other are the bosons , a nasty band of anarchists who respect nothing - at all events , not this  |||  principle  |||  , which means that they can indeed be found in the same place at the same time .
in fact , if you can read this article , it is thanks to an extraordinarily banal boson : the photon , or the "  |||  light  |||  particle " which is the " messenger " of the electromagnetic force .
this " disturbance " produces an electromagnetic wave ( of  |||  light  |||  , infrared , ultraviolet etc. ) , and this wave is nothing other than a photon - and thus one of the " force carrier " bosons .
more stable  |||  field  |||
the same applies to the higgs boson , with the difference that it is  |||  another  |||  field , the higgs field , which must be " disturbed " for the boson to appear .
now , this higgs field is much , much more stable than the electromagnetic field ; to excite it , it is  |||  necessary  |||  to achieve very , very high energy levels , rather like a frozen pond which would need a very large rock to wrinkle the surface .
which is why a huge particle accelerator like the one at cern - the  |||  large  |||  hadron collider is a ring with a 27km circumference ! - is needed to achieve such energy levels .
in fact not all particles , or all materials , interact with the  |||  electromagnetic  |||  field .
some , such as magnets , do so , but  |||  others  |||  do n't - a piece of paper , for example , will never stick to a fridge .
for science , it serves to check the validity of the  |||  standard  |||  model ( sm ) , and also allows physicians to examine any discrepancies between the observations and predictions of the sm .
a number of people , moreover , fervently hope that some will be found , because the slightest difference could  |||  open  |||  a door to a " new physics " and plug certain holes in the model .
this , it must be said , still has  |||  huge  |||  shortcomings , offering no explanation for gravity ( oops ! ) or dark matter , which forms approximately 80 % of the matter in the universe ( re - oops ! ) .
the repercussions of this research on the daily life of the man in the street are more difficult to predict , but it would be  |||  wrong  |||  to assume that there wo n't be any .
they had an inkling of the scientific applications , but  |||  nothing  |||  as to the rest .
in fact , the late willard boyle - a physicist who worked at bell labs , where the laser was invented in 1960 , and who himself  |||  developed  |||  the first continuous laser ( the first were pulsed ) in 1962 - told us that initially the laser was rather seen as a " lab gadget . "
and then ,  |||  applications  |||  can also come from all the instrumentation that surrounds research .
this sensor , although this was not at all the original intention , now serves as an " eye " to all digital cameras  |||  worldwide  |||  , and earned him the nobel physics prize in 2009 .
this does not of course mean that the  |||  activities  |||  of the lhc will necessarily transform our lives , but it does mean that , actually , you never know ...
palliative  |||  care  |||  - the best way to die ... | le devoir
with its dying with dignity commission , quebec recently discussed the  |||  delicate  |||  issue of the end of life .
the debate is due to resume shortly as a  |||  bill  |||  is being prepared .
however , in this  |||  vital  |||  area , much remains to be done .
just a few weeks ago mr l. lived  |||  alone  |||  in his montérégie apartment .
the festering prostate  |||  cancer  |||  had allowed him a two - year respite .
" they gave me five years to  |||  live  |||  , i 've made it to seven , " he says , with mixed emotions , lying in his bed at the victor - gadbois palliative care home in beloeil , where he arrived the previous day .
" but it 's still a shock , you can never be prepared for it " he  |||  adds  |||  .
the disease is doing its work : huge weakness which prevents him going to the toilet  |||  alone  |||  , and even eating alone .
courageous , he even manages to smile , talks to the strangers bustling around him ,  |||  bringing  |||  him his medication , offering him a bath .
a few hours later , the  |||  team  |||  found a cure for this illness .
" during our lives , we  |||  learn  |||  that a man pisses standing up , " says pierre brodeur , psychologist at the victor - gadbois home .
" it depends on the person 's ability " to  |||  accept  |||  the regression , he says .
patients at the victor - gadbois palliative  |||  care  |||  home all suffer from cancer .
at this  |||  stage  |||  , the team of doctors and nurses surrounding them no longer provides so - called " curative " care .
for mrs a. , 89 years old , the worst  |||  fear  |||  is to die " conscious and suffocating . "
but the  |||  disease  |||  has made me discover my children .
" i have fine children " she  |||  adds  |||  .
" i do n't  |||  wish  |||  for anything more in life " she says , before accepting having a mask put on to help her breathe .
she looks forward nevertheless , in the next few days , to a  |||  last  |||  visit by her son coming from italy .
at victor - gadbois , a group of volunteers provides bodily care and  |||  help  |||  with feeding .
this is palliative care , given when there is nothing  |||  else  |||  that can be done .
to make death more  |||  comfortable  |||  .
in quebec , there are palliative  |||  care  |||  beds for 11,700 inhabitants .
here , life continues under the best possible conditions , explains dr christiane martel , one of the doctors at the  |||  home  |||  .
whether at a  |||  physical  |||  comfort , emotional or spiritual level .
and death is part of everyday  |||  life  |||  .
this morning , it is his son who will finish the  |||  beer  |||  at the feet of the deceased .
at the victor - gadbois home , one day follows  |||  another  |||  but no two are alike .
53 % of patients admitted to the victor - gadbois home come from their  |||  homes  |||  , 47 % from hospital .
it is said that 77 % of canadians simply have no access to palliative care , which is care  |||  designed  |||  to ease the pain when a patient has reached the terminal stage of life , be it at home , in hospital or in a care home .
and a number of organisations , such as the victor - gadbois home and the palliative care society in greater montreal , specialise more or less exclusively in  |||  care  |||  provided to cancer patients .
it is precisely this large gap in quebec health care which has made a number of palliative care physicians  |||  fear  |||  the adoption of a law on euthanasia and assisted suicide .
since october , a manifesto , signed by palliative care luminaries including dr balfour mount and dr bernard lapointe , has been circulating to  |||  demonstrate  |||  their opposition to such an initiative .
i 'm afraid that patients ask to die because they do n't receive  |||  adequate  |||  care .
and at the same time , some oncologists work relentlessly on their patients until the  |||  last  |||  day , despite the worst prognoses .
hélène richard 's survival  |||  hopes  |||  were already minimal when she ended her gruelling chemotherapy .
when i announced to my oncologist that i was stopping the treatment , she told me she regretted that i had given up  |||  fighting  |||  , she said .
but it must be said that palliative care is not absolutely all - powerful in the  |||  treatment  |||  of pain .
according to elsie monereau , palliative care director with the palliative care society in greater montreal , patients are resistant to  |||  treatment  |||  against pain in 8 % of cases .
increasingly , an unrelieved patient will have the  |||  option  |||  of having such palliative sedation .
but this does not necessarily  |||  mean  |||  " i want you to euthanise me , " it means " i want to be relieved . "
|||  widespread  |||  real estate scandals in quebec
day after day highway officials ,  |||  building  |||  contractors , political party fund - raisers and italian mafia specialists tell what they know of a formidable " system , " combining the building industry , government officials , politicians , trade unionists and organised crime .
" it is curious how the system is crumbling since we took drastic measures " says jacques duchesneau ironically , a quebec politician and  |||  former  |||  montreal chief of police .
it was through him that the scandal broke in 2011 , in an in - depth investigation into corruption related to road construction contracts in quebec , to which the liberal  |||  prime minister  |||  at the time , jean charest , had consented only reluctantly .
" since the inquiry opened in 2010 , he says , the ministry of transport  |||  alone  |||  reportedly saved a billion dollars on contracts , " with certain people curbing their instincts to get a share !
the  |||  permanent  |||  anti - corruption unit , created in 2011 , is also coupled with its army of government analysts , investigators , and auditors .
in recent weeks , it has  |||  conducted  |||  a series of searches and brought charges of fraud and corruption against municipal politicians , such as frank zampino and richard marcotte , mayor of a suburban town .
|||  next  |||  on the list is apparently gilles vaillancourt , who has just resigned from his post as mayor of laval , third largest city in quebec .
others formally  |||  accused  |||  are montreal highway engineers and italian entrepreneurs , including tony accurso and lino zambito .
he himself  |||  paid  |||  3 % of the value of the contracts obtained in montreal to an intermediary linked to the mafia who in turn paid the money to union montréal , mayor gérald tremblay 's party .
he also admitted having  |||  organised  |||  an illegal fundraiser for former liberal deputy - prime minister , nathalie normandeau .
sewer contracts with inflated  |||  costs  |||
in montreal , the corruption "  |||  system  |||  " ran smoothly .
gilles surprenant , former public works engineer , described it in detail in front of the commission : in ten years , he  |||  received  |||  from construction companies gifts , invitations to trips , golf tournaments , restaurants , hockey matches and bribes totalling 736,000 dollars , in exchange for sewer contracts of which he inflated the costs .
other highway officials admitted having their palms greased by inflating invoices by 30 to 40 % , and by  |||  false  |||  add - ons .
then an organiser of the mayor 's party , martin dumont ,  |||  accused  |||  mr tremblay of having deliberately closed his eyes to a parallel budget feeding his coffers with dirty money .
following these revelations , mr tremblay resigned in early november , plunging montreal into a  |||  major  |||  crisis .
mayor of the borough of rivière - des - prairies , to the east of the island , she protested in 2010 against the sale of municipal  |||  land  |||  bought for 5 million dollars and resold for ... 1.6 million to developers , at the height of the real estate boom .
70 % dirty money in  |||  election  |||  campaigns
on the investigation which will eventually be implemented , she says she " is following a thread in order to find out how the system - infiltrated by ants -  |||  works  |||  , to put a stop to the gangrene and catch the culprits . "
the process , she says , is "  |||  painful  |||  but positive . "
he advocates a  |||  complete  |||  overhaul of the system for granting public contracts and party funding : " we ca n't go any lower ; getting to the bottom of things , with courage , will help to rebuild the house on more solid foundations , with more controls and laws . "
although this story tarnishes the international image of quebec and montreal , mr duchesneau invites  |||  anyone  |||  laughing to look in their own backyard ...
" psg is not fc  |||  barcelona  |||  ! "
this  |||  season  |||  , you have taken on a new stature with psg .
it can be explained by  |||  individual  |||  awareness but also by the new dimension of psg .
some great  |||  players  |||  have arrived .
|||  every  |||  day i 'm making progress alongside them .
the  |||  technical  |||  staff has also brought me a lot .
day by day , all these things help me  |||  raise  |||  my level of play .
everything moves very fast in  |||  football  |||  .
so you benefit from the  |||  competition  |||  brought in by carlo ancelotti ...
this summer 's recruits are used to playing matches at a  |||  high  |||  level .
they also know that every training session is  |||  crucial  |||  .
on the other hand , carlo ancelotti gives me a lot as  |||  regards  |||  my position .
ancelotti inspires  |||  respect  |||  among all the experts .
he 's  |||  worked  |||  with great players .
the confidence he gives me also explains my  |||  performance  |||  .
in ligue 1 ,  |||  lyon  |||  overtook us at the top .
one of our  |||  main  |||  goals is the champions league : we qualified for the last 16 in the right way .
what is the club 's goal in this  |||  competition  |||  ?
from now on , anything can  |||  happen  |||  .
but we 'll have something to say against some very good  |||  european  |||  teams .
first of all , we want to finish top in our pool , ahead of porto , to have  |||  home  |||  advantage in the last 16 match .
can psg become a top european club in the  |||  short  |||  term ?
it already has the  |||  budget  |||  ...
to become a top  |||  european  |||  club , paris needs to win titles and keep it up over time .
in ligue 1 , would not winning the title , like last season , be a big  |||  failure  |||  ?
it was a terrific  |||  season  |||  .
normally , 79  |||  points  |||  is good enough to be top ...
but  |||  another  |||  team , montpellier , had an even more fantastic season .
even if big teams like marseille , lyon and bordeaux are competing for the  |||  title  |||  , i think we have the weapons to win .
do you think the  |||  media  |||  expect too much of psg ?
it 's normal for them to expect a lot from us given what 's been  |||  invested  |||  and the players we have .
we  |||  totally  |||  accept it .
after we won 4-0 at home against troyes and they still found  |||  things  |||  to blame us for , that 's definitely a bit frustrating .
you 're never going to win 4-0  |||  every  |||  weekend .
we 're not fc  |||  barcelona  |||  !
it takes time to build a  |||  team  |||  .
based on the amounts invested , you should be 15 points  |||  ahead  |||  at the winter break !
i hope that in may we will be able to smile in  |||  saying  |||  that , despite all the difficulties , we finally did it .
psg  |||  seem  |||  totally dependent on the exploits of zlatan ibrahimovic .
so much so that people say there is a " zlatan  |||  dependence  |||  . "
this  |||  means  |||  ibrahimovic is very successful and scores a lot of goals .
that 's why he came , and he 's proving he 's the  |||  star  |||  of ligue 1 .
he 's  |||  demonstrated  |||  everywhere he went that he was a great player , a world star .
within the group , we  |||  respect  |||  the man and the player .
and also he  |||  respects  |||  the men he has around him .
what he has done is truly  |||  exceptional  |||  .
it pushes others to  |||  raise  |||  their level of play .
thiago silva , who is one of the best  |||  defenders  |||  in the world , also helps everyone else progress .
how did you get on in  |||  euro  |||  2012 with the france team ?
a  |||  disappointment  |||  .
unfortunately , my injury prevented me from  |||  getting  |||  any game time .
today , i 'm  |||  playing  |||  well in selection matches .
which is what i 've been  |||  hoping  |||  for since my baptism with the blues .
i 've  |||  learned  |||  the lessons from what happened in the ukraine and i now owe it to myself to have exemplary behaviour .
what do think about didier deschamps 's first few months in  |||  charge  |||  of the blues ?
he has the  |||  results  |||  he wanted .
like  |||  laurent  |||  blanc was .
blanc had  |||  achieved  |||  his goal when we qualified for the euro .
i hope didier deschamps will take the blues to  |||  brazil  |||  .
that  |||  match  |||  gave us confidence .
|||  everybody  |||  fought for everybody .
|||  before  |||  that shock in spain , i 'd never experienced such a match in my career .
with bitcoin , pay and  |||  sell  |||  without banks
the opposite of current monetary exchanges , based on central banks ,  |||  identified  |||  transactions and processing fees among the parties involved .
in addition , as often in these technologies , a political vision is palpable : the belief that the  |||  current  |||  monetary system , made up of banking monopolies , leads to financial crises .
the bitcoin exchange rate , after reaching a peak of 30 dollars ( 23 euros ) in june 2011 , fell to 2 dollars five months later , returning today to around a dozen dollars ( rates are  |||  listed  |||  on the bitcoincharts.com site ) .
nothing very impressive , compared to global transactions in  |||  real  |||  currency or financial products .
however , the european central bank ( ecb ) took an interest in it in a report on virtual currencies  |||  published  |||  in october .
the social  |||  network  |||  facebook has also developed this kind of system .
but , on each occasion , a central  |||  authority  |||  controls and handles the exchanges .
how does the network  |||  operate  |||  ?
|||  each  |||  transaction between two users is actually carried out between two electronic addresses like with an e - mail .
except that a user can  |||  choose  |||  a different address for each payment , thereby ensuring anonymity .
a set of  |||  information  |||  associated with this transaction is signed electronically by a dual - key encryption system .
so the  |||  network  |||  can verify the authenticity of the transaction .
|||  using  |||  the contents of the file , it is also possible to ensure that the exchanged bitcoins exist in the public book of accounts , broadcast across the entire network .
the key step is entering the new transaction in the  |||  book  |||  .
it passes through the resolution of a mathematical challenge issued to the computers , and the winner , a  |||  kind  |||  of interim central banker , will have the privilege of adding this extra line .
this is a file hashing phase , i.e. the transformation of a large file into a shorter and  |||  unique  |||  digital imprint .
computers " take " the new transaction and add a  |||  number  |||  to it , then " hash " it all up .
the goal being to find the  |||  number  |||  that gives a special imprint ( lots of zeros at the beginning ) .
if a user wanted to defraud by paying twice with the same money very quickly ( less than ten minutes ) , only one of the two transactions would be validated by the network - the other would remain an orphan because the two have  |||  different  |||  imprints .
the  |||  computer  |||  that resolves the challenge wins 50 bitcoins .
to avoid inflation , this award is regularly  |||  divided  |||  by two , probably by the end of 2012 .
the number of bitcoins in circulation is therefore  |||  limited  |||  to 21 million , but they are divisible down to the hundred millionth , which leaves some margin ...
the life of the  |||  network  |||  has had its ups and downs .
websites  |||  providing  |||  services for bitcoin have been attacked and bitcoins in deposits stolen .
" the loophole used is not the protocol itself " says pierre noizat reassuringly , who has just launched paymium , a  |||  real  |||  currency payment company that uses the bitcoin network .
the ecb also highlights the possibilities of money laundering  |||  using  |||  this anonymous service .
|||  major  |||  players like wikipedia refuse donations of this nature .
|||  others  |||  , such as the wordpress blog platform , accept them .
recently , adi shamir and dorit ron , from the weizmann institute in israel , analysed the accounting books and  |||  showed  |||  that almost 80 % of bitcoins do not circulate .
in november , "  |||  huge  |||  sell - offs " were launched .
" thirty thousand dollars were exchanged " welcomes jon holmquist , who  |||  works  |||  for coinabul , which converts bitcoins to gold .
pierre noizat , also author of an educational book on this currency , has a lot of faith in the  |||  potential  |||  of this technology as a transaction network .
his system , paytunia , is equivalent to a credit card ( in  |||  real  |||  money ) or a contactless payment by mobile , but it uses bitcoin to validate transactions , which are thus cheaper .
also the user  |||  manages  |||  his identity and can therefore be anonymous .
the system is  |||  easy  |||  to implement by merchants , who do not need to install new terminals or software .
they just need to provide an  |||  address  |||  that a phone can " photograph and recognise " says pierre noizat , who confirms he has thousands of users .
there is a  |||  general  |||  movement to reappraise hierarchical systems for more horizontal systems .
" it will take time for bitcoin to  |||  become  |||  firmly established , but 2013 could be a turning point , " he predicts .
we got out of  |||  afghanistan  |||  .
|||  french  |||  troops have left their area of responsibility in afghanistan ( kapisa and surobi ) .
nato and the americans are due to follow in  |||  late  |||  2014 .
it is time for the afghan army to resume possession of its territory and the afghan people to  |||  choose  |||  their future , without expecting us to do everything .
and ourselves , with our 88 soldiers  |||  killed  |||  , plus the wounded , the maimed .
the taliban is composed of foreign extremists , former  |||  leaders  |||  in refuge in pakistan , but often peasants who refuse the presence of foreign armed forces , like in the time of the soviets .
they want to  |||  defend  |||  their traditions , both ancient and archaic , even though they have been joined by jihadists , pakistanis , arabs , uzbeks , tajiks .
tolerated , sometimes assisted , by  |||  local  |||  insurgents , the latter will no longer be so when westerners become more scarce .
the departure of  |||  french  |||  troops from the nijrab base , which i observed from the top of hills of almond trees planted with french funding , was carried out in an orderly fashion .
circumstances have  |||  changed  |||  since their irresistible advance between 1994 and 1996 .
at that time kabul was empty , the country being torn apart by the struggles between  |||  different  |||  factions .
their takeover of the country had been perceived then as a sort of liberation , a return to  |||  safety  |||  .
afghanis  |||  paid  |||  the price of the obscurantism of these peasants by the organisation of al-qaeda , but their situation has not improved today .
former mujahidin , the afghan government and the current taliban are allied in the desire to  |||  keep  |||  women in an inferior position .
they became profiteers , seizing government land to resell as building land to refugees returning from iran and pakistan , benefiting from  |||  huge  |||  american outsourcing contracts .
they have become discredited ; what is more , most of them did not  |||  fight  |||  themselves .
the people , as i  |||  heard  |||  in the countryside , want a government that is not made up of thieves .
the young people are tired of war and its  |||  ideologies  |||  .
they have rubbed shoulders with the modern world during their exile in iran or pakistan , and appreciated the  |||  benefits  |||  .
roughly 65 % of the population is less than 25 ; kabul now has 5 million people , a fifth of the  |||  total  |||  population .
in towns and cities , the state schools are  |||  full  |||  , with girls and boys alike .
it will be necessary to provide work for those young people who no longer want to return to the obscurantism of the former parties or the corruption of certain  |||  leaders  |||  .
the army is now  |||  present  |||  .
will the authorities who command it be  |||  considered  |||  legitimate ?
former commanders of the  |||  anti  |||  - soviet struggle are already thinking about restoring provincial militias , which will escape the central power .
president karzai does not want any foreign  |||  controls  |||  , particularly on the occasion of the elections in april 2014 .
but , since the 50s and already well before , his country has been  |||  dependent  |||  on foreign aid .
no industries have been re - established , no dams are in good condition , no  |||  major  |||  irrigation systems have been repaired .
everything is  |||  imported  |||  ; nothing is produced , apart from fruit and vegetables .
the priority is left to  |||  private  |||  initiative .
in a country ruined by thirty years of war , government control over the infrastructure would have been  |||  necessary  |||  .
the rumour was spread that afghanistan had  |||  huge  |||  mineral wealth .
with no energy to process the iron ore or copper on site , or means of transport to export it  |||  across  |||  the mountains , there is no mining .
the chinese have already almost  |||  left  |||  the mes aynak copper mine , leaving international archaeologists ( funded by the world bank ) to search the huge buddhist site and remain the largest employers in the province .
the departure of  |||  french  |||  combat troops was completed on 20 november .
the new cooperation treaty provides for the continuation of traditional aid : girls ' high school , boys ' high school , french department at the university , french institute , cooperation in the military , legal ,  |||  medical  |||  and agricultural fields , support to the archaeological delegation .
since 2009 , to try to " win hearts and minds " and achieve the impossible task of reconciling aid and offensive  |||  actions  |||  , a " civil - military actions " service from the ministry of defence ( cimic ) , closed in 2012 , has carried out , and continues to carry out successfully , through a small french ngo , many community and agricultural rehabilitation projects in dozens of mountain villages .
what will we leave as a souvenir , after two billion euros of  |||  military  |||  spending ?
a much more modest budget would contribute to improving local  |||  living  |||  conditions , which are very hard in these valleys often located over 2,000 metres above sea level .
the embassy has received dozens of written requests for  |||  small  |||  agricultural projects from local communities in kapisa province .
a new gamble for  |||  president  |||  mohammed morsi .
taking everyone by surprise , he announced on wednesday that the constituent assembly would vote on its  |||  final  |||  text the following day .
just a week ago , the head of  |||  state  |||  had given the assembly two more months to finish its work .
this new  |||  initiative  |||  has only served to enhance the divide in the country .
according to his  |||  opponents  |||  , the president is persevering in his " autocratic delirium , " continuing to " go back on his word " and ' trample the law . "
his  |||  supporters  |||  affirm that this is the quickest way to put an end to the institutional and political crisis , by speeding up the transition process .
a referendum is due to be  |||  held  |||  within the next two weeks .
a very  |||  short  |||  period , which forces the brothers to abandon their plan to explain the text , article by article , to the egyptians .
mohammed morsi  |||  seems  |||  convinced that egyptians will vote favourably , as he stated in an interview with the american weekly time .
in mid - november , shortly before the constitutional declaration , they had slammed the door , feeling they had failed to assert their  |||  views  |||  .
representatives of human rights ,  |||  religious  |||  minorities or civil society had done likewise .
some of them are very close to the  |||  muslim  |||  brotherhood .
the text , which was still being voted on yesterday evening , has 234  |||  articles  |||  .
the main focus of attention , article 2 , remains in the  |||  final  |||  analysis identical to that of the 1971 constitution , stipulating that " the principles of sharia are the main source of law . "
the salafist parties , for which the establishment of islamic law is a  |||  major  |||  claim , were hoping to replace " the principles " by " the rules , " which would have allowed stricter application .
" hypocrisy " respond the  |||  liberals  |||  , who see only a communication coup .
because in their opinion islamisation of the constitution is done through other  |||  articles  |||  .
they refer in particular to article 220 , which grants al-azhar university an advisory role , with  |||  particular  |||  reference to verifying the conformity of the laws with sharia .
according to egypt specialist sophie pommier , this is worrying because " the people called upon to advise are not  |||  elected  |||  and have no democratic legitimacy .
the liberals ' fears are also fuelled by the fact that the next rector of the university will probably be much less moderate than the  |||  current  |||  one .
" for the time being , there is no concrete  |||  religious  |||  implication .
most of the lawyers who worked on this text are not islamic law scholars but academics , some trained in the  |||  french  |||  system " qualifies alexis blouet , who is writing a thesis on the egyptian constitutional transition .
but he acknowledges that " there may be some ambiguity  |||  regarding  |||  article 220 , because the terms used borrow from the religious vocabulary .
reference is made in particular to " fiqh " [  |||  islamic  |||  jurisprudence , editor 's note ] .
and the question could be asked in future to what extent civil judges are  |||  competent  |||  to pronounce on it . "
|||  beyond  |||  its religious aspect , the text voted on yesterday is highly criticised due to the extensive powers it grants to the president of the republic .
the muslim brothers argue that they are significantly  |||  reduced  |||  compared to what they were under the former regime .
in accordance with the wishes of the military , the  |||  defence  |||  budget review will be not submitted to parliament , but to a national defence council .
nor will trials of civilians will be banned in  |||  military  |||  tribunals , as requested by associations for the defence of human rights .
the offence of blasphemy is maintained and insults are now prohibited , which could have  |||  serious  |||  consequences on freedom of expression , particularly for the press .
in addition , no longer does any of the articles refer to the protection of women , highlights heba morayef , from human rights  |||  watch  |||  .
in her opinion , the only  |||  positive  |||  point is the prohibition of torture in article 36 .
the  |||  word  |||  was not included in the previous constitution .
while the egyptian president was speaking yesterday evening on television , demonstrations are  |||  planned  |||  for this afternoon .
|||  supporters  |||  of the head of state will march on saturday .
in israel , holy places await  |||  ukrainian  |||  tourists , the omphalos and a sea of saline water
the holy land combines the splendour of biblical truths , modern comfort and primeval  |||  nature  |||  .
aif [ argumenti i fakti ] newspaper highlighted the five most important reasons why it is a must to  |||  visit  |||  israel .
let 's worship the  |||  holy  |||  places
it is worth visiting the river  |||  jordan  |||  where jesus was baptized .
it is considered that all who  |||  enter  |||  this baptism " bath " are blessed by god .
galilee is the place where jesus performed his magic : turned  |||  water  |||  into wine at a wedding , walked on water , calmed a storm , and filled the nets .
but the biggest number of  |||  holy  |||  places is in jerusalem .
|||  believers  |||  walk through the way of grief or via dolorosa .
it starts by the antonia fortress - praetorium - where the judgement  |||  took place  |||  , and brings us along the streets of the old town to the church of the holy sepulchre on golgotha - the place of the crucifixion , stone of unction and the place of jesus ' burial .
this is also the  |||  location  |||  of the symbolic christian omphalos , which symbolizes the salvation of mankind .
the holy  |||  cross  |||  monastery in jerusalem is erected at the site that , according to christian legend , yielded the tree used to make the cross for jesus ' crucifixion .
according to tradition , people of  |||  different  |||  faiths leave notes here with their wishes , which are then fulfilled .
ruins of the massada fortress remain from a secret refuge from enemies ,  |||  built  |||  by herod in 25 bc for his family .
they are  |||  located  |||  on cliffs in the mountains at an elevation of 450 m above sea level .
|||  others  |||  are delivered to this historical mountaintop by a cableway .
in the north of the country , at an elevation of 1600-2040 m , there is a  |||  famous  |||  ski resort called hermon , which fills up with tourists in winter months .
according to an ancient legend , pagan gods used to  |||  live  |||  on the mountain .
visit  |||  unique  |||  museums
this country has about 300  |||  museums  |||  .
you wo n't be able to  |||  visit  |||  all of them on one trip
but at least the five most interesting ones are worth a  |||  visit  |||  .
among them - museum of israel , located  |||  close  |||  to knesset ( parliament ) .
it has  |||  ancient  |||  qumran manuscripts and dead sea scrolls found in the caves of the judean desert , along with about 500,000 archaeological and anthropological artefacts .
the fifth one is the holocaust museum or yad vashem in tel - aviv , which tells one of the most dramatic stories in  |||  history  |||  .
you go in and find yourself in  |||  complete  |||  darkness .
|||  stars  |||  are glimmering ,
and you listen to names of  |||  jewish  |||  children and countries where they died .
there are three resort areas in israel , located on the coasts of the  |||  mediterranean  |||  , red , and dead seas .
it is notable that one can swim in the red sea even in winter months , because the  |||  water  |||  temperature does not drop below 21 degrees and the air warms to 23 degrees .
the  |||  dead  |||  sea is even warmer , and people swim in it all year round .
incidentally , it is the most unusual sea in the world , located in the lowest  |||  point  |||  of the planet - 417 m below sea level .
its azure  |||  water  |||  is saline and easily keeps you afloat , even if you do n't know how to swim .
people come here to undergo a course of treatment  |||  using  |||  salt water - wraps and medicinal muds , and to improve their health if they have dermatitis , allergies , asthmas , eczemas , arthritis , bronchitis , or diabetes , or to return emotional balance .
they are preserved in the old section of tel - aviv - in the town of jaffa on the  |||  mediterranean  |||  sea .
the  |||  famous  |||  sea route connecting egypt , syria , anatolia , and mesopotamia runs through it .
according to legends , this is where noah  |||  built  |||  his ark and perseus saved the beauty andromeda , with whom he lived a long and happy life .
they say , if you touch the walls on the street of your  |||  sign  |||  , fortune will come to you .
in jaffa , you can meet newlyweds who come from all over israel and even from other  |||  countries  |||  for photo sessions .
and in caesarea - the city of king herod - you can walk around a roman  |||  theatre  |||  , " capture " the crusader fortress .
during the roman period , caesarea was the main  |||  city  |||  of judea and the residence of roman prefects , including pontius pilate .
when you go to israel , do n't worry about your bad english knowledge : approximately 30 % of the country 's  |||  population  |||  speaks russian .
for the trip , it is better to take dollars , not euros , because they are easily exchanged for shekels (  |||  currently  |||  1 dollar = 3.8 shekels ) .
city  |||  transportation  |||  is mainly buses , but jerusalem has a high - speed tram , and haifa has the only subway line in the country , comprising six stops and connecting upper town with lower .
a ticket for any type of city  |||  transportation  |||  costs 6 shekels , and you can ride for 1.5 hours with transfers .
|||  according  |||  to the jewish tradition , sabbath is celebrated in israel .
the work week starts on sunday  |||  morning  |||  .
the streets of  |||  israel  |||  do n't have homeless dogs .
in the evening , they can even be seen sleeping on roofs of parked  |||  cars  |||  .
plus  |||  insurance  |||  of 15 dollars a day .
museum entrance  |||  costs  |||  30 shekels on average .
in  |||  numbers  |||
in 2012 , over three million tourists from  |||  around  |||  the world visited israel .
while deputies and human rights activists argue about the purpose of the law on mandatory  |||  language  |||  testing , the country already has scam artists who sell fake certificates .
|||  every  |||  year , 13 million migrant workers come to moscow , st. petersburg and other cities in russia .
mostly these are citizens of  |||  central  |||  asia : uzbekistan , tajikistan and turkmenistan .
their only goal is to earn money to  |||  support  |||  families back home .
a new law came into  |||  effect  |||  on december 1 , which obliges every migrant worker to pass a russian language test .
but with time - as  |||  promised  |||  by the federal migration service - tests will become mandatory for all non - residents .
in addition to language ,  |||  russian  |||  history and basics of the legal system will be tested .
language knowledge will have to be confirmed both to  |||  receive  |||  and to extend the work permit .
an exception is in effect only for citizens of countries where  |||  russian  |||  is a state language .
migrants can take the tests in all cities ; more than 160 such centres have been  |||  opened  |||  .
the initiative to introduce the testing was  |||  supported  |||  by state duma members and the federal migration services .
but human rights activists , asked the question repeatedly in the press  |||  before  |||  the law came into force : what will it actually achieve ?
what will the obligation to know russian change for the  |||  russians  |||  and for the non - residents ?
first of all , according to representatives of the migration service , this will allow to reduce the  |||  number  |||  of people suffering from labour slavery .
many speak about protection of the rights of work  |||  migrants  |||  , explains the head of the representative office of the federal migration services of russia , viktor sebelev .
rights protection should  |||  begin  |||  before their departure .
only the system of  |||  organized  |||  selection will enable us to solve 90 % of the problems of foreign workers .
migrants without profession , education , who do not know russian , who do not have a  |||  medical  |||  certificate start to have problems .
if a migrant does not understand the language , says sebelev with certainty , he is doomed to come across unconscientious people , who , pretending to  |||  help  |||  , will force upon him a " ticket " to terrible , cramped barracks where many others like him will suffer without food and documents , slaving away 12-14 hours a day .
we  |||  receive  |||  many complaints from our migrants .
nonetheless , many citizens of central asian countries , who plan to go to work in russia , admit that not only their understanding of the  |||  language  |||  of the country where they are going is not good , but they can barely write in their own language .
naturally , this is not so much their  |||  fault  |||  , but due to poverty : very few turks , uzbeks , and tajiks can afford even a basic education .
their families do n't even have food to feed their children , not to  |||  mention  |||  decent clothing , shoes , and supplies .
after reaching adolescence , these kids go to work at the first  |||  opportunity  |||  .
it is hard , if language  |||  knowledge  |||  is bad , they admit .
" you feel  |||  humiliated  |||  and inferior . "
but human rights activists note one important point about the law on  |||  language  |||  .
testing will be  |||  conducted  |||  only for those migrants who have legal status .
if they have no status , there will be no testing , nor any official work in the  |||  future  |||  .
in the meantime , most of the migrant  |||  workers  |||  continue to live in russia illegally .
"  |||  welcome  |||  , or no unauthorized entry "
many of the foreigners assert that  |||  receiving  |||  official status in our country is not that easy .
the reason lies in bureaucratic hurdles and the already mentioned language  |||  difficulties  |||  .
in addition , legalization  |||  costs  |||  money : from 12,000 to 16,000 rubles .
officers of the  |||  russian  |||  police know that we mainly have fake papers , without registration , hence the extortion .
" they ask for a hundred or two for cigarettes , tea , " umed khushkadamov , a  |||  citizen  |||  of tajikistan , shared with journalists .
a few forged certificates about passing  |||  language  |||  tests have been seized by federal migration services officers already .
forged documents are printed on a standard  |||  colour  |||  printer .
it is two and a half times more than the process of  |||  official  |||  testing , which costs three thousand .
government officials and human rights activists agree that the main goal in the  |||  near  |||  future is to protect the system from corruption , so that the certificates could not just be bought .
in addition , those who come without  |||  russian  |||  language knowledge will be offered work in areas that do not require active communication with people .
the  |||  russian  |||  ministry of the interior is proposing to toughen up the law for owners of civil weapons .
this is the reaction of authorities to  |||  recent  |||  incidents : click shots at weddings , where there were no casualties , and the massacre staged by moscow lawyer dmitry vinogradov , resulting in click the death of seven people .
policemen want to prohibit the carrying of weapons in public places and  |||  raise  |||  the legal age of weapons licensing from 18 to 21 .
the idea was  |||  supported  |||  by the head of the duma committee on safety and anti - corruption , irina yarovaya , who promised that the amendments to the law on weapons will be brought to the state duma in the near future .
not everyone is  |||  happy  |||  that the russian authorities are trying to fight the problem by " tightening the screws . "
an open letter appeared online , whose authors - representatives of  |||  different  |||  social rifle organizations - demand to abandon the " senseless toughening . "
according to the ministry of the interior 's statistics , 142 crimes  |||  using  |||  firearms registered with law enforcement agencies have been committed in the six months of 2012 , whereas 1,168,000 crimes have been recorded in total for this period .
authors of the  |||  open  |||  letter are certain that the toughening of the law in the area of civil weapons will not prevent the criminal from going to the " black " market .
according to them , one can find any  |||  weapon  |||  at a low price right now .
nonetheless , the ministry of the interior asserts that the situation of the spread of  |||  illegal  |||  arms is under control .
suppliers : from  |||  plants  |||  to officers
the " black "  |||  market  |||  of weapons is replenished through several channels .
there are five such channels , explains retired colonel viktor baranets , who has worked in the ministry of education and the  |||  general  |||  staff for 10 years .
screenshot of the site that accepts  |||  orders  |||  for weapons .
first : " army or military loot , " i.e. weapons that were stolen during the  |||  fighting  |||  in the caucasus .
" weapons were stolen by  |||  russian  |||  officers and by the caucasians , " says baranets .
|||  next  |||  are " black weapons , " stolen by criminals from representatives of defence agencies .
illegal arms are taken to be  |||  sold  |||  from military warehouses .
explosions have often been heard at  |||  military  |||  warehouses .
manufacturers of weapons make their contribution ,  |||  according  |||  to baranets .
" there are so many private weapons factories now , which do not endure competition on the international market and throw weapons from under the counter to the black market , including in moscow , " says the  |||  expert  |||  .
|||  another  |||  source of the " black " market is trafficking .
an especially high number of guns and machine guns come from  |||  poor  |||  countries like kyrgyzstan .
" there 's production there , sometimes handmade ; and a mafia has formed , which has organized a stream , " explains the  |||  former  |||  military man .
experts counted the approximate share of each of the sources of supply of  |||  illegal  |||  weapons to the " black " market .
the overwhelming majority of  |||  illegal  |||  weapons , according to the researchers , comes from the military and security forces .
half of all arms on the black market are there " because of officials , whose work is  |||  connected  |||  with weapons , " states the report .
according to  |||  researchers  |||  ' data , 17 % of the time the weapons are received from armed conflict areas , 14 % is theft during production , 5 % is " black archaeology . "
according to him , dealers go to the  |||  military  |||  warehouse for a new batch of goods .
it is issued to him , and given through the  |||  fence  |||  .
" the truth is that police are aware of everything , that is why periodically , when the crime detection rate is low , it conducts test purchases from  |||  illegal  |||  weapons merchants , " says the consultant .
" like in a luxury  |||  store  |||  "
i found out the  |||  price  |||  of the weapon only there
|||  military  |||  commentator viktor baranets
there are salesmen on labour markets , but one  |||  needs  |||  to " come " there conditionally " from john doe , who asked to tell that his daughter lost a tooth . "
beginners look for weapons in  |||  different  |||  ways .
former military man viktor baranets tried himself as a buyer of  |||  illegal  |||  weapons in the mid - 1990 's , when he was preparing to publish an article about this .
he was given an album of pictures with "  |||  anything  |||  and everything . "
" i  |||  felt  |||  like i was in a luxury store , " he recalls .
internet searches lead to sites and " vkontakte " groups , where weapons " for  |||  different  |||  purposes " are on offer .
no documents or personal meetings are  |||  needed  |||  .
" it 's enough to have a certain sum of money , " says the advertisement heading on the  |||  website  |||  " buy a pistol or rifle . "
users  |||  leave  |||  their requests and ask questions .
" without a license , of course , " asks  |||  user  |||  " john " ( name is changed ) .
" want to buy a tt ,  |||  moscow  |||  , " concisely requests " fedorenkov . "
federal security service now spread a big network of fake sites and there are tons of potential buyers of  |||  military  |||  weapons .
|||  military  |||  commentator and former military man viktor baranets
viktor baranets confirms that after leaving a request on the site you can  |||  stay  |||  without a weapon and go to jail .
the federal security service now spreads a big network of fake sites and there are tons of potential buyers of  |||  military  |||  weapons .
makarov for 100  |||  dollars  |||
when buying  |||  illegal  |||  firearms , 100 to 900 dollars is enough according to experts .
according to dmitry kislov from the  |||  rights  |||  to weapons organization , a makarov gun can be acquired for 100-300 dollars .
the wait time is a  |||  month  |||  to a month and a half .
according to official statistics of the authorities , the number of such crimes in russia on the  |||  whole  |||  dropped 7 % as compared to january - october 2011 , amounting to 22,900 , while the number of cases of theft and extortion of weapons , ammunition , explosive substances and explosive devices dropped by 7.8 % .

in the last few days , there is a wave of protest actions in the u.s.a. against low salaries in supermarkets of the walmart chain and  |||  popular  |||  fast food chain restaurants like mcdonald 's , burger king , taco bell , wendy 's and kentucky fried chicken .
right now , nobody is able to predict whether this wave will turn into the ninth wave or it is destined to fizzle out  |||  early  |||  .
in addition to increasing the low wages  |||  received  |||  by employees of walmart and fast food chains , the goal of the protesters is to create unions within them .
this sector of the  |||  economy  |||  is not covered by any union movement yet .
46  |||  cents  |||  a year ?
|||  actions  |||  began last week after thanksgiving , on black friday , when massive sales drew millions of people in america , sometimes accompanied by clashes .
on this day , some employees of the walmart corporation , which employs 2.2 million people around the world ,  |||  left  |||  their workplaces and picketed together with the unions and left - wing activists from the corporation stores that sell products to people on low - to - medium incomes .
walmart sells everything imaginable , from diapers , hunting rifles and car batteries , to vacuum cleaners , eggs and  |||  milk  |||  .
products in its stores are on average 8 % to 27 % cheaper than in  |||  major  |||  supermarkets .
availability and assortment made walmart one of the biggest  |||  american  |||  corporations .
according to critics , walmart can afford to sell the products cheaply partly because it pays  |||  little  |||  to its employees .
these latter also complain about hard work conditions , for example  |||  lack  |||  of lift trucks and hand - held scanners .
protesters on black friday demanded a salary increase and complained that the cost of medical insurance  |||  provided  |||  by the corporation went from 30 to 100 dollars a month .
a typical walmart employee ,  |||  receiving  |||  9.5 dollars / hour , cannot afford this .
scientists from the berkeley  |||  university  |||  in california argue that if walmart raises the average salary to 12 dollars / hour , it will cost the corporation 3.2 billion dollars .
this is about 1.1 % more than it  |||  spends  |||  on salaries right now .
if walmart fully shifts the cost of  |||  increasing  |||  wages to the shoulders of consumers , each visit to the store will cost only 46 cents more .
in one year , they will only  |||  spend  |||  12.39 dollars more than now .
protests  |||  continued  |||  this week in new york , where their object was not walmart ( they 're not so welcome in the progressive city , that is why they do n't exist here yet ) , but mcdonald 's and other cheap restaurants .
jumaane williams , member of the city  |||  council  |||  of new york
at the  |||  moment  |||  , the minimum salary according to federal and ny law is 7.25 dollars an hour .
fast food restaurants  |||  increase  |||  it with time , but very little . on average their ordinary employees in new york earn 8.90 dollars / hour .
i cannot understand how one can survive in new york on this  |||  money  |||  .
once upon a time , almost a fourth of american teenagers went through mcdonald 's , working part - time after school ,  |||  living  |||  with parents .
few saw this as a source of living or  |||  planned  |||  to stay there for long .
participants of the protest that began at 6.30 a.m. on thursday near the mcdonald 's on 40th street and madison avenue demanded that cashiers and cooks of the fast food chain be paid at least 15 dollars / hour , i.e. more than double their  |||  present  |||  wages .
|||  american  |||  law prohibits the administration from preventing this or punishing activists of the union movement by nagging or firing .
on the other hand , the  |||  administration  |||  does not often ease their life .
but for objective reasons it is  |||  hard  |||  to cover fast food with a union .
noisy protests began on this day in a number of other  |||  cheap  |||  restaurants in manhattan .
the highlight of the  |||  action  |||  was the afternoon meeting near mcdonald 's by times square , where several local democratic politicians spoke out . one of them , jumaane williams , said : " mcdonald 's claims it sells billions of portions , and despite this it does n't even give you sick days or pay you for honest work ! "
demonstrators were  |||  supported  |||  by other prominent ny democrats , like bill de blasio , a candidate for ny city mayor , who said : " we need to voice our joint support for the fast food employees , so that they can achieve fair wages and economic wellbeing , which every new yorker deserves ! . "
according to the new york times , this was the biggest  |||  action  |||  of this kind in the history of the american fast food industry .
but only a few  |||  hundred  |||  people took part in it , and many of them were not fast food employees , which comprise tens of thousands of people in new york .
it is unclear right now whether this will spark a  |||  mass  |||  movement .
among modern technology fans a  |||  popular  |||  topic is augmented reality , lately seen primarily through the prism of special glasses .
at first , a functional model was shown by google in the summer , at its annual conference . then , in november , it was  |||  announced  |||  that microsoft filed an application for patent too .
however , according to the conversation with the  |||  leader  |||  of the group of interactive 3d technologies in the cambridge laboratory of microsoft , shahram izadi , glasses are a thing of the past for scientists in this company .
- we work on the interaction of people with  |||  machines  |||  , at the same time trying to expand the boundaries of this interaction .
while people in general are stuck at  |||  working  |||  with pixels on a flat screen and sometimes pointing fingers at them .
for example , xbox and kinect sensors are a step forward . almost no xbox is  |||  sold  |||  without kinect today , because everyone likes control by gestures .
- what  |||  else  |||  awaits us in the future ?
- despite the fact that kinect shifted the interaction to the  |||  physical  |||  level , much still occurs on a flat screen , sometimes in 3d .
information entry has  |||  improved  |||  ( the system receives more data ) , but output still needs to get better .
we are trying to change this , working on truly three - dimensional display systems  |||  based  |||  on various technologies , including projection technologies .
we need to let the computer world into our  |||  physical  |||  world , make it more tangible .
then we will be able to supplement the  |||  real  |||  world with virtual objects in a much more convenient form .
above all , get rid of these stupid virtual  |||  reality  |||  helmets !
- what do you think about voice  |||  control  |||  ?
it 's a popular  |||  thing  |||  , but is it overestimated ?
- it clearly cannot be called a cure - for - all - there 's a question of privacy , because we do not always want to let the others know about our  |||  actions  |||  and intentions .
in  |||  reality  |||  , all types of interaction with computers are good , but each in their own niche .
for example , we had a project to control devices in public places , in which we  |||  thought  |||  about movements , not wide movements , but small , reserved ones .
in general , the future lies in the mixed  |||  control  |||  , e.g. movement + voice .
-  |||  usually  |||  i just say .
- oh , that will be very  |||  hard  |||  to detect .
- so you want to make the users adapt to what the machine can or cannot do at that  |||  moment  |||  ?
- not necessarily , but it is a  |||  mutual  |||  approximation .
this could be , e.g. laser sensors . they have a decent depth resolution , which is very  |||  important  |||  .
- if we talk about your work with xbox kinect sensors , what are your complaints about  |||  modern  |||  cameras ?
not enough resolution ,  |||  depth  |||  or something else ?
- in general , the  |||  current  |||  generation is what we can base ourselves on in working on three - dimensional recognition .
of course , it would be good to have eight mega pixels with 1000 k / s  |||  speed  |||  .
it 's not just the mega pixels , though , but the quality of the matrix and the  |||  depth  |||  .
from the latter point of view , all  |||  current  |||  technologies are not good enough for us - this adds work to the algorithm designers .
so it 's important to remember about the  |||  resolution  |||  on the x , y , but also the z axis .
speed , the number of images per  |||  second  |||  , is also very important .
human movements are relatively dynamic , and the  |||  current  |||  30 k / s is really not enough , especially for gestures .
steven bathiche from our redmond laboratory created a touch sensor with a regulated processing  |||  delay  |||  from 1 to 100 ms , while modern serial sensors are closer to the latter indicator ( 60-100 ) .
not everyone understands how this affects the interaction between man and  |||  machine  |||  .
- does the number of  |||  cameras  |||  need to be increased ?
- in kinect there are three cameras now , one of which is actually an infrared emitter and the  |||  second  |||  one , the recipient of the signal .
the third one is actually a regular sensor of visible  |||  range  |||  .
it is not applied to determine the object 's  |||  depth  |||  .
potentially , a  |||  large  |||  number of cameras could solve the problem ...
or make it worse , by increasing the  |||  required  |||  volume of calculations .
it would be nice to create a  |||  flexible  |||  analogue kinect , play with the flexion of camera disposition and see how this will help in three - dimensional determination of the position .
- as far as i remember , microsoft did not present its glasses to the  |||  public  |||  , unlike google .
do n't you think this is one of the most promising platforms from the point of view the everyday use of augmented  |||  reality  |||  technologies ?
- let us imagine for a minute that manipulation of virtual holographic objects in the air is  |||  available  |||  not only to tony stark from ironman , but to a regular person .
there is one problem with this idea that the  |||  critics  |||  often point out : no tactile feedback !
hands  |||  feel  |||  nothing !
what answers does your group  |||  prepare  |||  to this challenge ?
- in my lectures i often say that augmented  |||  reality  |||  is the seventh consecutive attempt at the interaction between man and machine .
i think that the eighth will probably be the  |||  addition  |||  of tactile sensations .
there are also wrist bracelets that  |||  affect  |||  the nerve endings in fingers , which is also a promising area .
to force it to think that it feels something that it should be feeling when it  |||  sees  |||  something ?
- this is a good  |||  idea  |||  and we have n't tried this yet .
it conceals one challenge that will not be solved so quickly - how to force a person , who is physically in a very limited space to believe that he is walking along an open , almost limitless space ; we are working on the concept of treadmills ( not at all like in clubs ) ,  |||  moving  |||  platforms , and giant balloons .
that 's what makes  |||  working  |||  on virtual reality so attractive to researchers - many things are in their very beginnings .
judgement calls  |||  instead  |||  of culture - rosbalt.ru
this top list already includes outstanding figures of the art scene of st. petersburg , whose achievements reach  |||  beyond  |||  the scope of the city , often recognized in europe , bypassing fame in russia .
the whole city knows kirill miller , a bearded man dressed all in red , who can be seen by the  |||  russian  |||  museum , or by the summer garden , or at fashionable parties and shows .
kirill miller 's work always brings in  |||  crowds  |||  of people , no matter where they are exhibited .
kirill miller is one of the purely st. petersburg  |||  social  |||  and philosophical storytellers and creators of new mythology .
moreover , he is a  |||  city  |||  man , who makes people smile on the street and lifts up everyone 's spirit .
recently he took up the street organ and became st. petersburg 's music man , because he was ready for this  |||  complex  |||  role with all his bohemian existence , philosophy and image .
- kirill , why do you walk around the  |||  city  |||  all in red , not yellow or turquoise , for example ?
in this  |||  world  |||  , red is a compromise between artist , image - maker and society .
|||  although  |||  in society , everything that is not grey causes aggression and agitation of the bad kind .
the whole history of my provocative  |||  actions  |||  is an invitation to discussion .
- at an exhibition in the nevsky  |||  house  |||  of culture , where my work was displayed .
it became clear to me that this is my  |||  path  |||  .
then , the wave of older free , unofficial artists was gone , while new , free artists like me were not  |||  understood  |||  .
i became friends with the artists of the new  |||  wave  |||  , with post - gaza - nevsky style artists ( " post - gazonevschina " ) , which led to pushkinskaya - 10 , and the wave was no longer .
- and all this has been united in your art - clinic ... - it was important for me to find myself in the centre of the culture of st. petersburg , where all the  |||  best  |||  creative forces should come together .
shnur and his friends lip sang  |||  easy  |||  songs , wearing tight leotards , and the now trendy composer igor vdovin was with them .
when the group  |||  began  |||  to play live , it became leningrad .
trakhtenberg was the presenter of many programs before hali - gali  |||  times  |||  .
we gave them trakhtenberg , and a great career was on its way , but the basic education and mentoring he  |||  received  |||  from us .
that is where our staff and regular customers  |||  left  |||  for .
i am a hero of the  |||  last  |||  century , when culture meant something .
in 2000 , there was a poll in the press , for the people of our  |||  city  |||  prize .
i was nominated  |||  artist  |||  of the year , my climax came to an end .
in the new  |||  times  |||  , it is uncomfortable to work by old rules . i 'm a man of truth , honesty and culture of the last century .
in our time , it is easy to become popular , but culture and popularity are  |||  different  |||  . you can be popular , but not very cultural .
i will have a programme exhibit , "  |||  russian  |||  museum in clowns . "
clowns are a timeless  |||  category  |||  .
i was social before , now it is  |||  painful  |||  and scary to be like that .
but  |||  everything  |||  is blurred in clowns , tragedy is removed .
i like grotesque , i have grotesque  |||  ideas  |||  .
|||  nowadays  |||  , people are judged by appearance , not their inner qualities .
who knows , maybe you cannot shake his hand , and need to spit in his  |||  face  |||  .
- recently we saw you in the role of music man . - a cultural  |||  city  |||  should have such a character .
- maybe commercial art can also be  |||  beautiful  |||  ?
- nowadays ,  |||  commercial  |||  art should be neat , considerate , sweet .
there is a  |||  disintegration  |||  of cultures .
now , everybody is divided into micro societies , it 's hard to be liked by  |||  everyone  |||  .
now ,  |||  each  |||  cult hero has 100 fans .
- but  |||  several  |||  thousand come to stas mikhailov !
- the cast - outs go to see him , the sexual -  |||  social  |||  sphere is at work there .
but 300 people will come for culture , not 10,000 . in the end , there 's less  |||  management  |||  , money , everything dies out .
i have fans ; the  |||  main  |||  thing is not to betray them , not to spoil what i have earned .
i  |||  started  |||  with paintings , which people usually end with .
people say : spiritual culture ,  |||  consumer  |||  culture .
there is no  |||  culture  |||  in consumerism , it 's " from another opera . "
i am a man of yesterday 's culture . i grew up on examples of artists who lived  |||  poor  |||  and died in poverty , refused money for the sake of painting .
this is the  |||  culture  |||  i 'm for .
- good cultural  |||  experts  |||  .
there is such a thing : an official for  |||  culture  |||  .
there are good consultants in  |||  moscow  |||  right now .
here in st. petersburg , there are people who could be experts , but they are pushed to the side , because more advanced experts are  |||  needed  |||  , who will correctly evaluate these experts and give way to them .
even erart , but they 're  |||  different  |||  because they say honestly that we do n't accept all modern art . there are some artists , who need to find other museums for themselves .
- st. petersburg is not a cultural  |||  capital  |||  , moscow has much more culture , there is bedrock there .
we need cultural bedrock , but we now have more writers than readers . this is  |||  wrong  |||  .
in  |||  europe  |||  , there are many curious people , who go to art exhibits , concerts .
here , this  |||  layer  |||  is thin .
we need to make art fashionable , as it was in the beginning of  |||  last  |||  century .
give birth in  |||  space  |||
the earth is in  |||  danger  |||  .
|||  global  |||  warming or an encounter with a killer asteroid .
caravans of cosmic ships with humans on  |||  board  |||  leave in search of a replacement planet .
to  |||  save  |||  humanity , the question is how to propagate our race in conditions of weightlessness or on that replacement planet ?
i think the  |||  choice  |||  is small .
" venus and mars , " says senior researcher of the p.k. shternberg  |||  state  |||  astronomy institute ( gaish ) vladimir surdin .
life is  |||  possible  |||  only at a high altitude or on the orbit of venus ... in space .
four generations of peas grown in orbit were no  |||  different  |||  from their earth counterparts .
then , insects were bred in orbit ,  |||  small  |||  fruit flies .
we get an absolutely  |||  normal  |||  chick .
but then the  |||  problem  |||  begins .
having found no  |||  support  |||  , chicks were tumbling around in disorder .
after 10 hours , the newborns experienced  |||  complete  |||  atrophy of instincts .
chicks did not react to light and  |||  sound  |||  .
and the problem was that they simply  |||  died  |||  after four days .
" we bred chicks twice there , and then stopped , because it is impossible to work with them there , " says vladimir sychev , confirming the  |||  failure  |||  of the experiment with chicks in space .
in spring 2013 , experiments will  |||  continue  |||  .
there was an experiment with rats , who were sent to  |||  space  |||  with foetus .
" this was on bio - satellites , but again , it was a singular experiment and such research needs to be  |||  conducted  |||  , " says vladimir sychev .
but it 's hard to solve the problem of reproduction directly in  |||  space  |||  .
in  |||  principle  |||  , people , unlike animals , can .
homo sapiens have abstract  |||  thinking  |||  , and are able to create a fitting emotional background .
such experiments are not conducted for  |||  ethical  |||  reasons .
but women have been flying to  |||  space  |||  for 50 years .
the most valuable thing for humanity is the female  |||  body  |||  .
our " seagull " left and nobody on earth could tell whether she would be ok after flying to  |||  space  |||  .
whether she will be able to give birth after this  |||  flight  |||  .
" nobody answered this question , " says rocket and  |||  space  |||  industry veteran , vakhtang vachnadze .
in june 1964 , only a year after flying to  |||  space  |||  , the first woman in space valentina tereshkova gave birth to a daughter .
in 1988 , the second woman cosmonaut , svetlana savitskaya , who went into orbit twice and even worked in  |||  open  |||  space , gave birth to a son .
however , the  |||  risk  |||  remains .
we have few , very few cosmonauts , who were ok and had healthy children after  |||  long  |||  flights .
" what 's more , it is  |||  dangerous  |||  even for orbital flights , " adds pilot and cosmonaut , hero of the ussr , hero of russia , valery poliakov .
and yet , humanity needs to  |||  seek  |||  out some new avenues in biotechnologies , protection from radiation , creation of artificial gravity .
hydro - laboratory of cpk -  |||  mandatory  |||  phase of training for a flight .
here , cosmonauts practice skills of working in  |||  open  |||  space in zero - gravity conditions .
|||  water  |||  imitates weightlessness .
if for adults water is a foreign medium , although  |||  comfortable  |||  , for infants it is a native element .
small amphibians seem to confirm that life came to  |||  land  |||  from the ocean .
there is a connection with the fact that an infant spends about 9 months in amniotic fluid in the womb ; it is  |||  easier  |||  to get used to water after that .
" this is very  |||  little  |||  time to forget something , " says infant swimming instructor marina aksenova .
stomach and pelvic muscles usually  |||  quickly  |||  degenerate in weightlessness ; the ability to push out the embryo is reduced .
on the other hand , a baby also  |||  needs  |||  artificial gravity .
he will simply not have what he  |||  needs  |||  to survive .
for the moment , birth of children in  |||  space  |||  is just a theory .
however , with time , it will become reality , when earthlings will go to a faraway planet in their ships , and it will become the  |||  home  |||  for their offspring , who were born in space .
the czech republic has sound control bodies and a good standard of  |||  legislation  |||  when it comes to public contracts , but it lags behind in their application .
this was said by miloslav kala , vice - president of the supreme audit  |||  office  |||  ( nku ) in an interview for aktualne.cz .
" the law will never be perfect , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion , " states kala , commenting on the  |||  current  |||  situation .
|||  similar  |||  conclusions are also reached by the joint audit from the czech and german auditors .
as an example of improper  |||  practice  |||  , they cite petr necas 's approach to the so - called " svarc system . "
" the law must be set out one way or the other and if it prohibits something , then even the government 's head cannot  |||  prevent  |||  the work of its department , which is duty - bound to monitor and enforce , " asserts kala .
at the audit committee 's session in the house of deputies , you spoke about a joint project between the czech republic and germany , within which legislation  |||  relating  |||  to public contracts in both countries was compared .
this is about parallel auditing , which we began  |||  around  |||  two years ago .
simply put , this is about how european legislation governs the handling of public contracts , followed by individual state legislations and then the actual practice  |||  itself  |||  .
we brought all this together , and although the audit is not yet complete , some very interesting differences have become apparent - in  |||  general  |||  terms , our legislation might be even " more concise and complete , " however the actual practice is in certain aspects better in germany .
this confirms that  |||  creating  |||  more and more concise rules is not enough , and that attention must be paid to the actual application of these laws .
what does this project  |||  actually  |||  help you with , and what do you think its outcome will bring ?
economy means acquiring the required thing at a reasonable ( which does not always mean the lowest ) price , so that profiteering and possible  |||  criminal  |||  proceedings may be avoided .
these are domestic problems about the practical implementation of  |||  legislation  |||  relating to public contracts .
how does the audit system work in  |||  germany  |||  ?
is there an  |||  office  |||  like the nku , or is it organised differently ?
as far as the office is concerned , the bundesrechnungshof functions like our nku , and it is  |||  organised  |||  like ours , it also has a committee although it is appointed slightly differently , but basically both offices operate similarly .
the brh can only audit federal money , known to us as state  |||  funds  |||  .
public  |||  funds  |||  , which , for us , are administered by regional and municipal authorities , are audited by the federal courts of auditors there .
when it comes to their  |||  legislation  |||  , is it more straightforward than ours ?
overall , i would not like to make a comparison without any specific data , nevertheless in  |||  certain  |||  respects germany serves as an example , but it certainly cannot be said that it is better in every aspect .
that is  |||  certainly  |||  not true , but again , i prefer not to make such comparisons .
it should be said that even in a country we perceive as exemplary , they encounter a  |||  whole  |||  range of problems .
if that were not the case , they would gain nothing from working with our  |||  office  |||  , would they ?
the period since the amendment came into force has been quite  |||  short  |||  , so it has not manifested itself in our audit work yet .
since we carry out our audits ex - post , a certain  |||  delay  |||  has to be taken into account .
so do you see the adoption of this legislation as a  |||  benefit  |||  , or rather as another burden on the bureaucratic system ?
i believe this  |||  legislation  |||  is a step in the right direction , and i hope this will be confirmed .
a problem , which may  |||  arise  |||  here , is that the law becomes " too constrained " and will not be enforceable .
under the previous rules , parties being audited were already bound by their audit provider ( for example , in the case of regional operational programmes , the regional office ) to the fact that  |||  every  |||  infringement of public contracts law means a breach of budgetary discipline .
the system should prevent those who want to attack and abuse it , but not penalise those , who make a mistake on a technicality , which does not  |||  affect  |||  the final decision .
this kind of system will only  |||  increase  |||  pressure on bureaucracy .
the  |||  prime minister  |||  recently said the ods will not be burdening businessmen with audits of the so - called " svarc system " - what does this mean ?
the law must be set out one way or the other , and if it prohibits something , then even the government 's head cannot  |||  prevent  |||  the work of its department , which is duty - bound to monitor and enforce .
he may say : " let us  |||  change  |||  this law and relax it , " but he cannot say we should pretend it is not there .
on the other hand , it is a tragedy , when a bidder with the best  |||  offer  |||  is excluded on a technicality .
the law will never be  |||  perfect  |||  , but its application should be just - this is what we are missing , in my opinion .
roads are icy in places , but  |||  mostly  |||  passable .
in  |||  several  |||  places in the czech republic , the main roads are icy and snowy .
however , the  |||  majority  |||  of roads are passable , with extra care needed in places .
carlsbad  |||  region  |||
in the carlsbad region , the roads have been usable this morning , though in some  |||  places  |||  they were icy and snowy .
however , the ridges of the krusne mountains have around 30 centimetres of  |||  snow  |||  .
the r 6 high - speed motorway and  |||  primary  |||  roads in the region are now usable without restriction .
caution is , of course ,  |||  appropriate  |||  , for example , on certain bridges , where the surface can be icy and slippery .
in  |||  certain  |||  stretches of these roads there might be remaining frozen and compacted snow patches .
pardubice and hradec kralove  |||  region  |||
on some roads in eastern bohemia , there might be a risk of black ice , at higher altitudes and in the mountains there  |||  might  |||  be a layer of compacted snow , according to the road and motorway directorate .
the highway service is warning the drivers against black ice , which  |||  might  |||  occur at higher altitudes of the pardubice region in particular .
the i / 43 and i / 34 roads have been chemically  |||  treated  |||  around svitavy .
snow is particularly affecting the roads in the krkonose and orlicke  |||  mountains  |||  .
in eastern bohemia the day will be mostly  |||  clear  |||  to partly cloudy , and dry .
pilsen  |||  region  |||
the roads in the pilsen region have been usable this morning , with extra care  |||  needed  |||  in some places . drivers should take the weather conditions into account .
due to the existing snow and subsequent drop in temperature ,  |||  certain  |||  roads may be icy .
the d 5 motorway is drivable almost without restriction , but the road services  |||  recommend  |||  extra caution between the 80th and 131st kilometre marks .
most  |||  primary  |||  road surfaces are dry and frost - free .
olomouc  |||  region  |||
" in the sumperk region , traces of snow have remained at the  |||  highest  |||  altitudes .
their jesenik counterparts also made an outing overnight ; the roads all the way to the highest altitudes are now clear and wet following the chemical  |||  treatment  |||  , according to them .
the olomouc region 's roads are usable without restriction , while in the area of sternberk drivers should beware in wooded areas , where roads have  |||  remained  |||  wet .
usti nad labem region , liberec  |||  region  |||
since this morning , the snowploughs have reported several places , which are  |||  difficult  |||  to pass in northern bohemia .
besides certain snow - covered places , or some icy frost patches , the mountain  |||  road  |||  from telnice to kninice in the usti nad labem region is also closed , according to the police database .
according to meteorologists the conditions for this were perfect - rain and melting snow during the day , with a  |||  clear  |||  night and freezing temperatures .
adverse conditions are expected on the main sections of the i / 13  |||  road  |||  between the usti nad labem and liberec regions .
simon ornest : at the concerts we want a fusion of positive  |||  energy  |||
together with the tap tap band , we tend to joke about it ,  |||  saying  |||  that we might be the only band on earth that could draw enough positive energy to hold off or avert the end of the world completely .
we decided to make use of the marketing  |||  potential  |||  of the end of the mayan calendar , due on the 21st of december at 11:10 a.m.
on the eve , the 20th of december , at 9pm , 3 concerts will take place in  |||  parallel  |||  in prague , brno , and ostrava .
they will end at around the time when kiribati island in the pacific , which is 12 hours  |||  ahead  |||  of us , reaches the end of the mayan calendar .
initially it was probably my  |||  idea  |||  , later we worked all the details out with our designer , honza augusta .
apart from the fact that we want to collect enough positive energy to  |||  stop  |||  the end of the world , we also want to allow ourselves and the public to spare some thoughts for the state of our planet , when we , one day , hand it over to our children .
on the occasion of the end of the mayan calendar , we have also prepared a range of unique items , shoes , t - shirts , bags , and original keys against the end of the world , which can be purchased at www.e-tap.cz to  |||  support  |||  our cause .
the tap tap band , together with other artists , also recorded the so - called anthem against the end of the world , called " the end of the world is  |||  cancelled  |||  . "
of course , for the grand finale , as long as the  |||  world  |||  does not end beforehand .
it will be sung by all the artists at all the  |||  three  |||  concerts at the same time .
the words were written and the role of jesus in the video clip was  |||  played  |||  by tomas hanak , xindl x also sings in it ...
it turns out that most of them are interested and  |||  enjoy  |||  working with us .
what will the proceeds from the concert against the end of the  |||  world  |||  go to ?
equipping the wheelchair - accessible educational studeo centre , which is already in its  |||  sixth  |||  year , in collaboration with the citizens association tap from the jedlicka institute for the disabled .
tutors come in regularly to spend time with the jedlicka institute 's students and run activities , which they  |||  enjoy  |||  and interest them .
the students themselves do not have the funds to afford tutors , so we try to  |||  provide  |||  this for them in this way .
every concert sees the appearance of  |||  several  |||  bands and artists .
we have tried to compile a programme , which speaks for all ages , including  |||  children  |||  .
for example , in prague , chinaski ,  |||  support  |||  lesbiens , illustratosphere with dan barta , the tap tap , marian bango and jiri suchy will appear .
further  |||  details  |||  can be found at www.kpks.cz .
are you planning any more " bombastic events " in the  |||  future  |||  ?
next year , we would like to play at the czech  |||  national  |||  house in new york , and i personally - since we will be in the usa - would like to build in appearances in washington and chicago .
your international plans are not modest ; you have already performed , for instance , in madrid , brussels , london , and  |||  moscow  |||  .
we have five  |||  members  |||  in electric wheelchairs , which must be transported in the luggage area ; we must also , of course , carry around with us a lot of luggage and instrument cases ...
even in moscow , which we have just  |||  returned  |||  from , it all went smoothly .
thanks to these international trips , you will have had a chance to  |||  compare  |||  specific accessibility issues , public attitudes to disability and so on .
after madrid ,  |||  luxembourg  |||  , london and other places , where everything functions better than here , we have just witnessed that in the east everything is still in its beginnings .
fortunately , citizens associations are  |||  emerging  |||  there too that are trying to draw attention to the problems faced by people with disabilities .
and on the other hand , where do we still lag behind more  |||  advanced  |||  countries ?
it is important to mention that improvements to the current situation always depend on the efforts of the people who are  |||  affected  |||  .
public  |||  respect  |||  or accessibility is one thing , but it is only when we can become famous athletes , artists , actors , politicians , or lawyers that things will really begin to change .
so far there are only exceptional cases , people who are  |||  strong  |||  - willed .
i began my job as a tutor at the jedlicka institute , where i was surrounded by a lot of  |||  young  |||  people , who were interested in doing something .
since i am a musician myself - among  |||  others  |||  i play the saxophone - i started a music club with a colleague .
with time , as our moderator ladya angelovic  |||  says  |||  , it has grown a little out of our control ( laugh ) .
your popularity has only come about in the  |||  last  |||  few years , or am i mistaken ?
thanks to funds from the european union we can even afford top  |||  quality  |||  tutors , equipment and so on .
from the outset , i  |||  felt  |||  there was potential to do things a little differently .
it is  |||  logical  |||  in its own way ; all new things are taken in hesitantly and take a long time .
things , which are  |||  unique  |||  , are few and far between , but i would dare to claim that tap tap is one of those things .
a person 's first impression on seeing you is , of course , pity - it is a  |||  natural  |||  reaction ...
but that pity is simply wasted , because handicapped people are not  |||  abandoned  |||  and suffering beings , who need to be pitied .
they are people , who can fully  |||  live  |||  life and blossom , assuming , of course , that they have the right environment for it .
i say that when a person with a handicap succeeds in something , it is not just  |||  progress  |||  for them but for society as a whole .
has your success also been helped by your firm hand as a  |||  leader  |||  , as many people are suggesting ?
if we want to achieve top class work , we must be uncompromising in many  |||  things  |||  and require a certain level of discipline .
some people come to us with a romantic idea and their  |||  head  |||  in the clouds , and when they find out they have to go to rehearsals twice a week , attend practice sessions and put up with a lot of time travelling to concerts , their enthusiasm quickly disappears .
that is how it works everywhere , with  |||  every  |||  group that wants to work and wants to achieve something .
the tap tap band currently has twenty  |||  members  |||  .
those who have the interest and the drive will always find our door  |||  open  |||  .
the event takes place the day before the end of the world is  |||  expected  |||  , on thursday 20.12.2012 from 9pm .
the venues will be praha incheba , brno fleda , and ostrava plynojem with performances from 12 bands and other musicians from the  |||  czech  |||  republic .
all three cities will be joined by a televised link - up at the evening 's  |||  close  |||  for a united rendition of the tap tap 's anthem " the end of the world is cancelled "
admission fee to the concert is 400 czk , children under 12 years of age go  |||  free  |||  , tickets on sale from bohemiaticket .
|||  poland  |||  and the cosmos .
|||  last  |||  week the council of ministers of the european space agency admitted poland as the twentieth member of the agency , being the second nation from the former eastern block ( after the czech republic , which became a fully fledged member of the esa on the 12th of november 2008 ) .
poland began  |||  close  |||  cooperation with the esa in 1994 , and in the following years it has participated in a series of agency projects .
of course , poland 's path to the space had begun much  |||  earlier  |||  .
i look back , for instance , to the lecture of a sternfeld in warsaw 's astronomy observatory , who , on the 6th of december 1933 ,  |||  presented  |||  ideas on his pioneering work entry into space .
in 1934 , for his work entry into space , sternfeld  |||  received  |||  the robert esnault - pelterie and andre louis hirsch prize in france .
he  |||  published  |||  hundreds of articles in polish journals , and wrote a series of books on these scientific subjects .
in 1925 , poland had already  |||  built  |||  a handcar which was supposed to be fitted with a rocket engine .
information about this rail track is only  |||  known  |||  from press articles of the time .
from the documents , it is clear that the research  |||  reached  |||  the stage of practical tests .
of course , the advance of the  |||  german  |||  army interrupted the research .
in 1937 , the concept of a photoelectric homing rocket  |||  designed  |||  by engineer rohozinski appeared in the trade press , and in the following year the rocket - air torpedo and flying rocket - bomb appeared , authored by leliwy - krywoblocki .
both projects were destined for  |||  military  |||  use of rocket engines .
immediately prior to the war , all projects for military use of rocket technologies were overseen by the provisional scientific advisory board ( tymczasowy komitet doradczo - naukowy ) that  |||  coordinated  |||  all the work .
further work devoted to astronautics appeared in the  |||  polish  |||  press after the war thanks to the polish astronautics company ( polskie towarzystwo astronautyczne ) .
the first reference to the company figures in the november  |||  issue  |||  of the magazine problems in 1954 , in which four in - depth articles are on the subject of astronautics .
in one of these , by prof. subotowicz , the establishment of a company is  |||  proposed  |||  , which would dedicate itself to astronautics .
at the time , there were already projects underway for artificial satellites and it was  |||  clear  |||  that cosmic research was an emerging sector .
he served in this capacity  |||  until  |||  his death in 1959 .
from 1956 , the pta played a significant role in the  |||  successful  |||  development of meteorological rockets rm ( rakieta meteorologiczna ) , which became the first polish rocket to enable scientific research .
the first rm - 1 model was completed in 1957 and the first launch  |||  took place  |||  on the 10th of october 1958 .
the rocket , with a ceiling of 1800 metres , measured  |||  around  |||  80 cm in length and weighed a little under 5 kg .
a further development model was designed for  |||  real  |||  scientific work - the rm - 34 rocket was to reach 14.5 km and be tasked with monitoring high altitude winds .
three models were  |||  developed  |||  ( designated meteor - 1a , -1b , and -1c ) , which differed in the room available for scientific apparatus .
in the meteor - 1a rocket , a  |||  space  |||  of 0.4 litres was available , meteor - 1b had 0.34 litres , and meteor - 1c had 0.62 litres .
the maximum altitude for all  |||  three  |||  models was 37km .
between 1965 and 1968 , the  |||  development  |||  of meteor - 2 was underway in the aeronautics institute , with its first launch tests in october 1970 .
the meteor - 2 rocket had a launch weight of 380 kg , and was  |||  capable  |||  of lifting a useful load of 10 kg to a height of around 60km .
subsequently  |||  built  |||  models were the meteor - 2h and meteor - 3 .
poland 's admission to cospar ( committee for space research ) in 1960 should be  |||  mentioned  |||  , as well as the appointment of a national cospar board two years later .
poland also participated in the interkosmos space programme for space research on soviet artificial satellites , and in 1978 , the  |||  polish  |||  pilot miroslaw hermaszewski became the second intercosmonaut after vladimir remkov .
abolishing the  |||  legislation  |||  on public works is not the solution .
the resolution  |||  caused  |||  lively public debate .
it will certainly be interesting to  |||  look  |||  at this issue from a broader perspective .
liberally oriented financial systems in the eu , just as those in the globalised world , are  |||  based  |||  on the principle of an unregulated economic competition .
its effect means that individual financial entities and national economic systems are in a state of  |||  permanent  |||  conflict among themselves .
the cause is the principle of free trade and free , completely unregulated movement of private  |||  capital  |||  together with uncontrolled financial speculation .
due to  |||  significant  |||  labour cost differences ( salaries ) there is pressure on prices .
on this basis , it should be understood that when a supplier tries to compete in a commercial tender by importing cheap goods , " the rug is pulled " from under the competition 's prices to capture a greater market share and , in this way ,  |||  increase  |||  its own profits .
since private capital is not bound by social responsibility , and therefore also not by the unemployment it causes , the social costs born by the state must necessarily  |||  increase  |||  .
the  |||  whole  |||  situation is bolstered by the businessman 's complete unwillingness to pay taxes , which would alleviate the economical and social harm caused in the pursuit of profit .
the situation is so well known that there is no need for  |||  actual  |||  statistical data .
the ruthless private capital practices create particular economic situations , where the state in these countries is forced to enter in the mutual competition , aiming to artificially lower the social standard of its own citizens in  |||  order  |||  to attract foreign investment .
in other words , governments stake their own citizens because of private  |||  capital  |||  while disregarding the drop in social standards .
this occurs chiefly in amendments to  |||  existing  |||  law .
this yields growing poverty and an  |||  increasing  |||  void between the poor and the rich .
in germany there are already a host of food hand - out centres for the  |||  poor  |||  , who are not able to feed themselves on their own wages .
the number of these people is already in the  |||  millions  |||  .
in the name of improving the competitiveness of the german economy , it commonly occurs that properly employed people  |||  receive  |||  such a salary that the state needs to top it up to the minimum wage .
just such a scandal was revealed in the case of auxiliary  |||  staff  |||  in the bundestag .
this applies to all of latin  |||  america  |||  .
liberal theory and the media incessantly claim that the state may not participate with capital in its own economy , and that a  |||  controlled  |||  economy leads to economic ruin .
private  |||  capital  |||  cruelly insists on the viewpoint that the state must not intervene in the economy .
the  |||  proof  |||  is the existence of the almost omnipotent , and in all states , omnipresent lobby .
in germany the situation is such that state ministries , through lack of financial resources , contract out the drafting of laws to private law firms , who are basically  |||  connected  |||  with industry .
real power does not come from the people as the western - style constitutions claim , but from  |||  strong  |||  financial organisations that look after their own interests .
it is clear that liberally - orientated democracies will now quickly reach a situation , as is described by appian in his work on the roman republic crisis in the time of cesar and pompei : " the state was already long in  |||  complete  |||  degeneration and its offices taken by force .
with bribery ,  |||  illegal  |||  acquisition of benefits , and with stones or swords .
the conclusion , just as in antiquity , the  |||  current  |||  society is built on unscrupulous tendencies for personal gain without regard to the interests of society as a whole .
private  |||  capital  |||  in its present state is not able to understand the interests of society as a whole .
the outcome is now , as it was then , an  |||  unprecedented  |||  decadence of the elite with no attempts whatsoever on deeper reaching reforms .
the causality of the rise of the fascist and communist regimes should therefore be sought in the misguided liberalisation of the  |||  economic  |||  system in the 19th and 20th centuries .
the  |||  current  |||  state of affairs , when we consider the demise of those systems in favour of liberalised democracy as an interlude , can expect its next cycle .
the particularly catastrophic reality is that the current elite is completely ignoring the potential  |||  lost  |||  of hundreds of thousands of lives , humanitarian and social disasters , which we are already witnessing , as well as crimes against humanity , as we are familiar with from ancient and modern history .
under the pressure of economic competition , internationally as well as within europe , the government of the czech republic will be  |||  forced  |||  to pursue ways of lowering the population 's living standards .
this pattern is  |||  thus  |||  systemic .
to address this , there are targeted political and social reforms , which strengthen the state 's capital participation in the economy ,  |||  increase  |||  the people 's influence over the state and weaken the monopoly held by private capital over society in favour of the state .
|||  israel  |||  : chaos lab.
" nothing comes from violence and nothing  |||  ever  |||  could , " from sting 's fragile , where one of the main verses from the refrain is " lest we forget how fragile we are . "
" if my sons did not want war , there would be none , " said the dying gutle schnapper ,  |||  wife  |||  of mayer amschel rothschild in 1849 .
the  |||  latest  |||  wave of violence between israel and the gaza strip , as always , has sparked a lot of reaction .
some  |||  stand  |||  by israel , arguing it has the right to self - defence , and palestinians are portrayed as terrorists , while others support the palestinians , claiming racism by the israeli state , claiming that genocide is being committed against palestinian arabs , and that israel is a terrorist state .
i do not want to dwell , in these repeated periodic waves of killing , on who is the transgressor and who is the victim , after all , today 's inhabitants of israel , including the self - governing territories , were born into the  |||  current  |||  political situation , and did not live through the start of the violence .
i would like to offer the readers a peek behind the scenes , a  |||  look  |||  at whom , most of all , this 95 - year long tension is serving ( starting from balfour 's declaration in november 1917 ) on this small piece of land in the middle east .
some of my thoughts are  |||  supported  |||  by available historical facts , while others are derived from my own understanding of who , that is , which group of people is the main source of events in modern history .
human history is in the first instance about the struggle for  |||  power  |||  .
in  |||  every  |||  era we can find an alexander the great or a napoleon .
what is not quite so apparent is whether these were the people , who had chosen their path independently , or whether behind their throne stood someone who directed their  |||  actions  |||  towards a pre - calculated goal .
we must accept that we live in a time when the world 's wealth is concentrated into the hands of a few individuals , and that this concentration of wealth and the power it exudes could not  |||  happen  |||  in one generation 's lifespan .
among these astronomically rich families , one stands out , which could be  |||  considered  |||  the puppet master ( whether someone else stands above them , i am unsure , but i would not rule it out ) - the rothschilds .
|||  understandably  |||  .
they hold majority stakes in almost  |||  every  |||  central bank in the world , and against the countries , where they do not hold a stake , they are either waging or preparing for war ( before the assault on afghanistan it was 7 countries , after iraq it was 5 , after the overthrow of kaddafi 4 remained , but in the meantime russia submitted its central bank to the russian government ) .
whoever attempted to defy this  |||  family  |||  died .
abraham lincoln refused to renew the status of the central bank to the rothschild bank of america , and during the civil war he began to  |||  issue  |||  his own ( that is state - issued ) money and was assassinated in 1865 at the theatre .
their thirst for global  |||  power  |||  led in the years of 1859 - 1871 to the formulation of a three - world - war plan by the freemason leader of the 33rd degree , albert pike .
the first war was to remove the  |||  large  |||  monarchic state bodies in europe , the second was to remove colonial rule , especially from great britain , and the third will reduce the world 's population down to 0.5 - 1 billion people ( this number of slaves will suffice for their comfort and luxury , and will not use up so many resources ) , the creation of one universal faith ( ecumenism is just an appetiser for this solution ) , and finally the seizing of absolute power .
the method , which the group of wealthy families with the rothschilds leading the way , employ is the instigation of crises , followed by the offering of a solution (  |||  order  |||  ab chao - order from chaos ) .
these solutions are false , however , and always lead to a worse situation ( vide establishment of the fed , so that the crisis of 1907 would not be  |||  repeated  |||  ) .
thus , having succeeded in assassinating ferdinand , the habsburg heir to the austro - hungarian throne , in sarajevo thereby unleashing world war i , they  |||  destroyed  |||  tsarist russia with the bolshevik revolution .
the first world war ended abruptly , militarily and economically unsubstantiated , with german capitulation ( the war was no longer  |||  needed  |||  to destroy tsarist russia ) and the central european powers of austria - hungary were subsequently dismantled .
at the end of the 19th century , the rothschilds instigated the establishment of the zionist movement , one branch of which strove to form the jewish state , seeking out an area of historic judea , jerusalem , to make its capital ( the  |||  return  |||  to zion ) .
the aforementioned balfour declaration formed the basis for the  |||  mass  |||  immigration of jews to palestine , where the first conflicts began with the local arab population .
terrorist attacks  |||  occurred  |||  on both sides .
world war ii broke out , and whether hitler broke free from the leash , which international bankers were holding him on , or whether his actions were all part of the plan , is difficult to determine , nevertheless the suffering of european jews in the concentration camps  |||  created  |||  the foundation to the world 's acceptance of the jewish state .
israel was officially formed in 1948 , and just as the war reparations for world war ii were layed on germany , the announcement of the  |||  state  |||  of israel became the third war 's hotbed .
|||  provided  |||  the international bankers succeed , the jewish nation , as with the second , will be the victims on the front line , now together with the arabic - or more generally , muslim - population of the middle east .
who is the wrong - doer and who is the victim in the palestine - israel conflict , where injustice breeds injustice in an endless cycle of violence , while everything began from the greed of a few and their lust for global  |||  power  |||  ?
here , we must differentiate between israel 's general population and their  |||  leaders  |||  , because , just as it happens here , the international bankers introduce their own selection of candidates for people to vote for .
israel 's  |||  current  |||  prime minister , netanyahu ' the hawk ' , is a typical example of a fascist politician , loyal to the international bankers , who does everything to instigate war with iran , which would , due to its membership in the shanghai cooperation organisation ( china , india , russia , pakistan , . . . ) lead to a greater threat of global conflict , and through its control of the hormuz strait , where 20 % of the world 's oil must sail ( the channel is only 2 miles wide ) , to the destruction of the world 's economy .
in what light stand the words , spoken by david rockefeller in 1994 : " all we need is a major crisis and the nations will accept the new world  |||  order  |||  . "
the new world  |||  order  |||  in their eyes is one of master and slave .
a world where the rest of the human  |||  population  |||  serve the luxury of a handful of financial aristocrats .
" he also  |||  forced  |||  everyone , small and great , rich and poor , free and slave , to receive a mark on his right hand or on his forehead , so that no one could buy or sell unless he had the mark , which is the name of the beast or the number of his name .
if  |||  anyone  |||  has insight , let him calculate the number of the beast ,
for it is man 's  |||  number  |||  . his number is six hundred and sixty six . "
argo : when things are at their worst -  |||  call  |||  hollywood .
they were to be released in  |||  exchange  |||  for the overthrown shah mohammad reza pahlavi , who fled after the revolution to the usa , which had actually supported his regime for several decades .
for the  |||  american  |||  administration the situation did not offer a positive solution - it could not throw the shah overboard , because this would seriously jeopardise the trust of other allied countries .
the release of the hostages in iran , where the revolution resulted in the establishment of the theocratic regime , could not be  |||  achieved  |||  .
this was a blow to the prestige of the united states , which was later compounded by the fiasco of attempting to  |||  free  |||  the hostages by force .
the incarcerated diplomats were finally  |||  released  |||  after 444 days , following negotiations mediated by the algerian government .
the film argo , directed by the actor ben affleck , recounts one episode in this story , which  |||  brought  |||  america a small victory .
just  |||  before  |||  the embassy was seized , six employees escaped .
after some peripeteia , they ended up in the  |||  canadian  |||  ambassador 's residence .
the plan , conceived by " exfiltration " expert , tony mendez ,  |||  required  |||  the assistance of hollywood .
for the story to be believed , the film project was reported on in specialist magazines , press conferences were organised , and the fictitious production company had a  |||  real  |||  office .
the details of the operation were , for a  |||  long  |||  time , kept secret ; the film draws on the memories of tony mendez .
affleck 's  |||  film  |||  is a peculiar mix of genres .
on one hand , there is a  |||  realistic  |||  incisive political thriller , and at the same time a " caper movie , " with small victories and double - crossing - another example would be ocean 's eleven .
the mood alternates in the film - on one  |||  side  |||  , sharp documentary - style sequences in tehran ( the title sequence shows iconic photos from news of the time , relating to the same events portrayed in the film - there are no big differences ) .
affleck  |||  shows  |||  it in argo , where tehran is " featured " by canada .
the best scenes of the film take place in the streets , in the reconstruction of  |||  real  |||  events - the opening sequence of the siege on the embassy is impressively lucid , creating at once feelings of confusion and surprise , which come flooding in , as history suddenly takes a turn .
a similar  |||  effect  |||  is achieved by affleck and his team in the fictitious scenes ( the fake staff at the tehran bazaar ) .
too much action in too many  |||  places  |||
the director had to tackle the issue that the story being told does not offer many nail - biting  |||  scenes  |||  for the film .
argo 's weakness is its divergence , which comes from the need to  |||  show  |||  too many events in too many places .
affleck 's film loses the dramatic pull a  |||  little  |||  , it is a film , which can be watched with reasonable interest , its production and retro - style are evocative of thrillers from the 70 's .
as a reminder of history 's particular ways and a testimony to how exaggerated the views are on the all - powerful all - controlling  |||  secret  |||  services , this will do .
|||  rules  |||  for blowing up balloons , for bananas and a circus
the www.bankovnipoplatky.com server , which issues a poll every year on the most absurd bank  |||  charge  |||  , has now decided to announce a competition for " the most absurd regulation or proposal from the eu . "
" we were prompted by the latest story , where the eu plans to take on a 40 percent quota of women at management level of europe 's largest companies , " patrik nacher , the poll 's organiser ,  |||  told  |||  pravo .
among the latest nominated absurdities , for instance , is the  |||  recent  |||  decision by the european court to unify insurance premiums for men and women .
until now , women were favoured in life insurance prices , because they constitute a lower  |||  risk  |||  for insurers .
" other unbelievable  |||  ideas  |||  from the eu can be nominated by anyone until the end of the year .
the actual voting will then take place until the end of february 2013 , "  |||  informed  |||  nacher .
among the controversial eu  |||  regulations  |||  , we might include the mandatory addition of bio - ingredients to fuel , which consequently harms the environment , the ban on reliable mercury thermometers just because they contain a relatively small quantity of a toxic substance , or the rules on the size of chicken cages , which significantly raised egg prices this year .
the ban on the use of the  |||  term  |||  " spreadable butter " and the withdrawal of classic light bulbs from sale had previously come under criticism .
the union 's machine often makes decisions under pressure from this or that commercial or industrial lobbying group , whose demands in brussels are usually defended by state or group of states ' interests ( just as the czech republic is  |||  promoting  |||  the demands of its banks under threat of being vetoed ) .
the lobby 's interests were , for example , that bananas of the highest  |||  quality  |||  should measure at least 14 cm in the eu , and were not to display and " anomalous curvature . "
the european commission defended itself ,  |||  saying  |||  that it was only harmonising existing disjointed national standards , which complicated trading .
norms  |||  relating  |||  to fruit and vegetables have already been softened by the eu despite opposition from certain states , referring to the food waste caused by the existing directives .
one possible prize - winner in the poll may be the last year 's eu regulation according to which inflatable balloons must be  |||  sold  |||  with a warning that children under 8 years of age may not inflate them without parental supervision .
here , the eu pointed to an  |||  american  |||  research , which indicated that , among other toys , balloons are one of the main causes of child suffocation .
strange  |||  ideas  |||  are conceived at home too
fairly absurd is the rule  |||  relating  |||  to individual european officials - everyone in the eu , who holds an official post , may not use the term macedonia due to it being a sensitive topic for greece , and instead the acronym fyrom ( former yugoslav republic of macedonia ) should be used .
the bankovnipoplatky.com server in collaboration with the liberal economist association , laissez faire , also nominated , aside from the aforementioned absurdities , for example the union 's regulation on the volume of food provision stocks held in an eu member  |||  state  |||  .
the eu stipulated the maximum volumes of  |||  food  |||  provisions , which may be present within the cr on the day of our entry to the union .
the czech republic thereafter exceeded , for instance , the permitted volume of mushroom preserves , which incurred a  |||  high  |||  penalty .
the poll 's organisers were also impressed by the idea of paying  |||  certain  |||  countries because they do not have a coastline , or the suggestion of allocating funding for a request for funding .
these  |||  ideas  |||  did not come from brussels , however , but from prague .
we are  |||  asking  |||  the european union for a refund , " declared the minister for agriculture , back in autumn 2004 , jaroslav palas ( cssd ) .
his argument was that there had been a good harvest of cereals , and due to the so - called buy - out interventions , the state 's warehouses were  |||  full  |||  and were forced to export .
the czech republic is further away from a port , so according to palas the eu should be  |||  paying  |||  us hundreds of millions of euros .
the european commission finally met the cr halfway by organising a tender for the  |||  purchase  |||  of cereals from countries that do not have access to the sea .
|||  regulations  |||  may well become the target of criticism among member states , but the eu 's efforts at regulation , more effective operation , and development of the entire union deserve recognition , according to a number of experts .
a more important  |||  issue  |||  , according to experts , is the drawing of eu funds on projects , which have hardly anything in common with strengthening the european integration , but which was pushed through by member states during a budget meeting .
emotions flare among czechs when , just as other countries in the union , the cr must fight in brussels for the  |||  right  |||  to particular labelling on its traditional products , in which it does not always succeed .
the czechs fought for six years with the germans and austrians to protect the labelling of their olomoucke tvaruzky , however the tuzemsky rum ,  |||  whose  |||  tradition reaches back to the 19th century here , had to be renamed tuzemak by the manufacturers .
the appellation of rum can only be given to  |||  products  |||  distilled from cane sugar , and not sugar beet .
carlsbad wafers , pohorelicky and trebonsky carp , and zatec hops have been added to the official list of  |||  registered  |||  products of the eu , alongside the world - renowned feta cheese and gorgonzola , german marzipan from lubeck , and parma ham .
this is not about me being a senator or  |||  president  |||  .
if everything in our country  |||  worked  |||  without problems , then i would not be running for any post .
i cannot watch any longer the country having been robbed over the past twenty years , thieves roaming about there and people 's taxes and retirement age  |||  increasing  |||  .
i had no  |||  ambition  |||  to be a politician .
when i see something i do not like , though , i try to find a solution to  |||  change  |||  things .
since i have already turned forty , and i am an independent non - party man , i have no other choice to influence things but to  |||  stand  |||  for senator or president .
i have been  |||  saying  |||  the entire time that i would fight for the castle based on the results in the senate 's elections .
later , i added that if i were  |||  elected  |||  as senator , i would be standing for president .
my  |||  goal  |||  , though , is not the post , the post is a tool to allow my vision to be realised .
the trouble is not just that as a nation we swear in the pub or at the television , but that we trample  |||  anyone  |||  , who wants to try to change things .
the  |||  media  |||  add to this , misleading the public , and mistaking freedom of speech with freedom to lie .
for  |||  example  |||  , i was allegedly bribing reporters , or i was allegedly an advisor of jiri paroubek .
you set out on your castle siege with a thesis on the material and  |||  criminal  |||  responsibilities of politics , and a retroactive financial disclosure of assets over twenty million .
you need to  |||  change  |||  the law for this .
as president , though , you do not have this  |||  power  |||  , and only the senate as a whole may propose laws .
when i lobbied , as a citizen , for tour guide work to be a  |||  free  |||  trade , it was successfully carried through .
as an independent non - party man , i stand a far better chance of gaining  |||  support  |||  from all parliamentary sides .
do you see yourself as a  |||  person  |||  from the right , or the left ?
for me , it just does not matter if it is a little to the  |||  left  |||  or right .
it is not about whether someone is from the  |||  left  |||  or right , i just want to bring people together .
i always support any good  |||  public  |||  solutions , even if they are put forward by the kscm or the ods , and , in the same way , i will oppose bad ideas .
you try to come  |||  close  |||  to it .
some may  |||  call  |||  it populism , but all the proposals i speak about are already working elsewhere , or they have been put forward by experts .
but without the support of the parliament you will be left with just  |||  slogans  |||  .
you will not last long in  |||  politics  |||  with that .
or do you  |||  believe  |||  that if you walk among the public and talk with them , that you will succeed , say , in passing criminal and material responsibility ?
i have no  |||  alternative  |||  .
i need to convince politicians , reporters , and the  |||  public  |||  , and try to get them on my side , so we can put this through .
if i were  |||  elected  |||  president , it would not be a problem to arrange a live television broadcast , where i ask the leaders of the parliamentary parties to pass a law on material and criminal responsibility for politicians , civil servants , judges , and the attorney general .
when there is a  |||  strong  |||  figure to point out the issues , it just needs some pressure on the political scene .
take for instance the direct  |||  election  |||  of the president , it was achieved thanks to public pressure .
i will say  |||  frankly  |||  that i am an amateur , i am not a genius or an intellectual .
i am  |||  looking  |||  for allies to share my opinions and vision .
it sounds a little like okamura is trying to save the  |||  czech republic  |||  .
i  |||  went  |||  to radim jancura , who declined due to his workload .
i put myself forward , because people are  |||  really  |||  discontented , but now i have my doubts .
sixty percent of people did not go to vote , and those who did mostly voted for leaders of the  |||  establishment  |||  .
in the  |||  senate  |||  , there are only two independents , including me .
people have voted for a senate that will make it  |||  difficult  |||  to enforce changes .
nonetheless , i will fight for my vision , for example , for the direct  |||  election  |||  of mayors or regional council presidents .
are you considering having your own  |||  party  |||  ?
i have not considered it yet , because i have neither the time to verify that  |||  every  |||  party member has a clean background , nor the money to do it .
i have no money even for a presidential campaign , my  |||  transparent  |||  account holds just 20 thousand .
you have no  |||  money  |||  ?
you are talking about financial disclosures , but what is  |||  yours  |||  like ?
i estimate my private assets to be  |||  around  |||  60 million .
i have the aston martin , by the way , because it was my dream as a boy - i always liked james  |||  bond  |||  , who drove the car , was gallant with women and also fought against evil and villainy .
you say you want to  |||  change  |||  the republic , but you are not keen on putting your own money into it .
i do not have 15  |||  million  |||  for a campaign .
i have already put 2.5  |||  million  |||  into the campaign .
i have no obligation to pay for my own  |||  campaign  |||  .
however , i would not be able to live on it , for instance , i could not pay for my son 's english  |||  school  |||  , which costs 30 thousand a month .
if i were only interested in making  |||  money  |||  , i would not be standing for election .
people would like me to be a samaritan , who saves the  |||  republic  |||  .
but i must also  |||  live  |||  off something .
as a businessman , what would you usually make  |||  monthly  |||  ?
two  |||  hundred  |||  to 400 thousand , which i still do .
and if i became  |||  president  |||  , then i would end my business activity .
the full interview can be read in saturday 's  |||  issue  |||  of pravo .
the mvrdv architects prove that true adventures are not just in the  |||  head  |||  - drawing on the example of spijkenisse and the recently erected bücherberg ( literally " book mountain " ) - 2 photos
and stefan spermon , it technician in a major  |||  firm  |||  based nearby commented : " it 's definitely a thing of beauty , the building . "
however , i do wonder why people would need  |||  another  |||  library in this day and age .
|||  everyone  |||  has the internet , an ipad and ebooks .
no - one goes into one of these old - style libraries voluntarily  |||  nowadays  |||  , or am i wrong ?
spijkenisse , a sleepy town outside the gates of rotterdam , which barely merits a  |||  visit  |||  , is a special record - holder .
the 80,000 - resident municipality has the lowest literacy  |||  rate  |||  in the whole of the netherlands .
in order to counteract this asinine situation , the decision was made a number of years ago to make a contribution towards  |||  general  |||  education and to recreate the seven fictitious bridges that feature on the euro notes as pretty , painted reinforced concrete miniatures .
winy maas of the rotterdam - based architectural firm mvrdv , master of audacious bar charts and producer of humorous and often cynical buildings , took the project on with his customary composure , and turned up at the competitive hearing in 2003 with five books under his arm and a grin on his  |||  face  |||  .
so this is my suggestion for the spijkenisse book  |||  mountain  |||  - for the so - called boekenberg !
nine  |||  years later  |||  , the 30 - million - euro mountain has been lifted up .
it is part of a revitalisation project , which also includes an underground car park , a supermarket , a post office and a small number of adjacent apartment buildings and terraced houses , with a  |||  total  |||  of 50 dwellings .
at the beginning of november , the bücherberg was awarded  |||  second  |||  place in the " best library of nl 2012 " competition .
in addition , the project is also nominated for the  |||  dutch  |||  national wood award 2012 .
thus , the faceless small - town retort , that until now had nothing more to  |||  offer  |||  than a post - modern pedestrian area and a stunningly ugly town hall , behind whose white facades one would expect to find a dairy plant , has been bolstered by a piece of contemporary architecture .
first and foremost , however , spijkenisse now has its first public cultural  |||  building  |||  in the history of its existence .
the  |||  long  |||  journey to the book
the first  |||  impression  |||  : the eldorado of books beneath a cheese dome .
there is in fact a lift that climbs through the centre of the mountain massif , however , the  |||  true  |||  joys of space and literature are revealed when scaling the topography on foot .
the urban ambiance is  |||  perfect  |||  .
you are already on the lookout for a park bench , a dog , and boys and girls playing  |||  football  |||  .
and everywhere there are  |||  books  |||  , books , books .
" normally book shelves run along the facade , and in the centre there is a large , dark  |||  space  |||  , which is usually unpleasant and impersonal , " says winy maas .
one particularly special feature are the  |||  black  |||  book shelves , which simultaneously act as wall cladding , parapets and railings for the stairway .
even die - hard architects and construction engineers shake their heads at the unknown  |||  construction  |||  materials .
" here we wanted to work with recyclable materials , " explained joop trouborst , project manager for the municipality of spijkenisse , on request of the  |||  standard  |||  .
and thus one day we stumbled across a suitable waste product used in agriculture , on a frisian  |||  farm  |||  .
for many years , millimetre - thick artificial fabric has been used in greenhouses and  |||  fields  |||  in the netherlands as a base layer .
the thin textile lasts for two seasons and is then disposed of as bulk  |||  waste  |||  .
for the library , the fabric was - for the first time in these quantities - pressed into four - centimetre - thick  |||  boards  |||  .
under heat and pressure , the so - called landbouw plastic ( klp ) changes colour to a dark , homogeneous and robust  |||  material  |||  , that smells like a mixture of new car smell and the smell of trainers .
after 105 steps you have  |||  reached  |||  the summit .
|||  donations  |||  for the new soul
the indoor temperature is very  |||  pleasant  |||  .
the  |||  rest  |||  is taken care of by fully automatic roller blinds .
so too has tcm - teacher , cynthia bogarde , who even  |||  refers  |||  to the boekenberg as spijkenisse 's " long overdue soul . "
the reason : at the inauguration just a few weeks ago , every citizen was  |||  invited  |||  to donate a book from his / her personal collection .
this was , for the time being , to fill the optical gaps in the not yet fully stocked library -  |||  currently  |||  there are 70,000 items .
" nothing is  |||  worse  |||  than a half - empty library , " said architect winy maas .
everyone knows that their book is part of the  |||  building  |||  .
spijkenisse has written literary  |||  history  |||  .
however  |||  young  |||  and uneducated it may be .
this is ultimately a starting  |||  point  |||  for identity .
szabo : " germans must play a greater  |||  role  |||  "
in the vote on the incorporation of  |||  palestine  |||  , germany abstained from voting .
according to stephen szabo ,  |||  expert  |||  in us - european relations , in so doing berlin is walking a thin diplomatic line .
deutsche welle : at the beginning of the week , germany had initially signalled that it would vote against the palestinians ' application for observer status within the united  |||  nations  |||  .
however , berlin subsequently abstained from  |||  voting  |||  .
stephen szabo :  |||  germany  |||  does not support what the israelis have done in gaza .
now , however , due to their special relationship with israel , germany must be  |||  cautious  |||  .
at the same time , however , i do not believe that it supports the  |||  american  |||  position either .
germany wanted to  |||  demonstrate  |||  its independence - albeit without being too critical of israel .
during the uprising in libya in march 2011 , germany likewise abstained from voting , when it came to  |||  establishing  |||  a no - fly zone .
this was  |||  ultimately  |||  implemented by nato .
does germany find it difficult to adopt a  |||  clear  |||  position when it comes to important international affairs ?
this situation is aggravated by the fact that the europeans do not have a coherent and standardised  |||  policy  |||  .
the germans  |||  thus  |||  find themselves caught between two fronts .
it is expected of them that they play a more  |||  independent  |||  role , yet this is something that they are not accustomed to .
a foreign  |||  policy  |||  similar to that of france , or great britain .
so what specifically does a " normal " foreign policy entail , from a  |||  german  |||  perspective ?
it shows a willingness to adopt  |||  positions  |||  on international matters , which are independent of those of the usa or european partners .
i believe that the german foreign policy is motivated by the economic policy , that is , by export and its relations with  |||  certain  |||  regions such as russia , china or the near east .
germany 's economic interests are to a  |||  certain  |||  extent different from those of the other major powers and therefore germany must protect its interests .
have these  |||  economic  |||  interests had an influence on their attitude towards the near east conflict and their voting in the un ?
on the one hand , germany has  |||  major  |||  revenue markets in the near east , and particularly in the gulf states .
therefore it must be  |||  careful  |||  not to affront the public , but also the elite in the arabic countries .
in any case , this  |||  plays  |||  a role .
however , i would n't want to ascribe too much  |||  weight  |||  to this . this is not an entirely one - sided relationship .
nonetheless , it does play an  |||  important  |||  role in germany 's considerations .
has germany  |||  damaged  |||  its relations with the usa , by abstaining to vote on important decisions , such as the vote on palestine ?
i think that in europe , and even in the usa , a great understanding for the  |||  german  |||  position prevails .
therefore i do not think that this was as  |||  dramatic  |||  a fracture as was the case in the matters regarding libya .
perhaps it will even earn germany a certain degree of  |||  respect  |||  .
after all , it signals that the country must be taken seriously as an international player and that its interests must be  |||  considered  |||  .
in europe there are  |||  diverse  |||  opinions regarding the palestinian initiative .
the usa , on the other hand , have spoken out  |||  clearly  |||  in favour of a veto .
are there differences of  |||  opinion  |||  between the usa and the many european nations ?
due to the  |||  american  |||  domestic policy , these differences have always existed .
i think that secretly , the government under obama actually has a  |||  great deal  |||  of understanding for the european situation .
however , due to the political situation here , the government is naturally  |||  unable  |||  to voice this position publicly .
it is my belief that the actual differences in opinion are not so  |||  vast  |||  as they always appear .
if you look at the relations between obama and  |||  prime minister  |||  netanjahu , obama is really not quite so enthused by netanjahu 's policies .
does germany find it difficult to reconcile its  |||  close  |||  relations with israel and the usa on the one hand , and the position of its most important partners in the eu on the other ?
i think that this is  |||  precisely  |||  what makes things so difficult for the germans .
it would of course be a little simpler for the germans if there were a coherent and standardised european policy , which is  |||  currently  |||  not the case .
thus they are  |||  unable  |||  to be part of a wider authority and must instead drive matters forward from their own position .
this is  |||  precisely  |||  what they are doing with the euro .
i believe that in the future germany will take on a  |||  leading  |||  role in urging europe towards a standardised european position .
this is , of course , no simple task for germany , on account of its relations with  |||  israel  |||  .
this has always been a sensitive  |||  subject  |||  .
yet i do think that germans are  |||  clear  |||  that they must play a more independent role .
does germany view  |||  itself  |||  as playing the role of an important international player - does germany actually want to assume a leading role ?
or does germany still find leadership  |||  roles  |||  difficult ?
germany is still not used to it , the country continues to be uncomfortable and , for  |||  obvious  |||  reasons , still finds it difficult to play a more prominent role .
if we look at the  |||  euro  |||  crisis for example , every time that germany assumes a more prominent role , various anti - german feelings become apparent .
this is actually the same old problem : one does not want to be surrounded by  |||  hostile  |||  countries .
from this stance , germany is in a much more  |||  difficult  |||  position than the usa .
it must be receptive to the most diverse of neighbours and opinions , and this is not  |||  easy  |||  .
the influence of the usa over european politics is continually diminishing , yet the eu is  |||  currently  |||  not feeling this vacuum , so who is filling the gap ?
the germans will simply have to play a greater  |||  role  |||  .

" brand protection " in china : when puma and armani suddenly become  |||  chinese  |||
armani is a world - famous  |||  brand  |||  , polo ralph lauren likewise .
behind this name hides a fully officially  |||  registered  |||  brand in china , however , one that has nothing whatsoever to do with the original companies .
and even then it is not  |||  clear  |||  whether they will have any rights .
" it is becoming increasingly more  |||  difficult  |||  for foreigners to protect their brands in china , " said thomas pattloch , lawyer within the taylor wessing law firm , who specialises in copyright infringement in the far east .
|||  every  |||  week a new case lands on my desk .
all the copycats require are a few additional letters in  |||  order  |||  that they can register their brands .
|||  german  |||  companies are also ' legally ' copied in this manner , such as manufacturer of sporting apparel , puma .
pattloch opens a file containing registrations with the trademark  |||  office  |||  in peking .
on 14 september 2010 a  |||  chinese  |||  company copyrighted the brand name zegna df puma there , an alias that also helps itself to the name of fashion retailer ermenegildo zegna .
the fact that the  |||  chinese  |||  are world champions in copying and infringing on intellectual property is well - known .
in the  |||  major  |||  cities there are multi - level department stores that sell counterfeit goods almost exclusively .
pattloch 's cases , however , are slightly different : on behalf of his clients he takes action against the fact that chinese companies can be granted the right to use a name by the trademark office , fully officially , which is already  |||  protected  |||  elsewhere .
the chinese  |||  call  |||  this " bang mingpai , " a passenger brand .
the  |||  word  |||  is based on " bang dakuan . "
this refers to women who latch onto  |||  rich  |||  men .
the chinese  |||  authorities  |||  are unaware of any wrongdoing .
" this harms  |||  business  |||  and we must fight against it , " challenges pattloch .
" the brand is watered down , its uniqueness disappears - the image damage is  |||  enormous  |||  . "
the financial losses and process costs of the affected branches amount into the millions , especially in the case of  |||  expensive  |||  flagship products .
according to information from market research company clsa , with a volume of 15 billion euros annually , china is the third largest market for luxury items , and the fastest  |||  growing  |||  .
however , the deletion of dubious entries in the trademark registry are  |||  difficult  |||  to achieve , and cost a pretty penny .
the process can last for up to nine years , with an  |||  uncertain  |||  outcome .
pattloch reports of instances whereby the court dismisses cases , because after a  |||  long  |||  period of time , the name to which the objection is being raised has become a " market reality . "
if the complainant is unlucky , he may even have to pay the plagiarist money for having infringed on his trademark in  |||  china  |||  , said pattloch .
|||  sometimes  |||  the law of the jungle prevails here .
|||  famous  |||  cases also relate to graphic elements .
in 2009 , daimler  |||  lost  |||  a legal battle with the construction machinery manufacturer sany , the company that recently acquired german concrete pump manufacturer putzmeister .
even today , the  |||  chinese  |||  company is therefore permitted to use an emblem that resembles the mercedes star .
volvo - purchaser geely originally used a blue and white logo that resembled the bmw logo ; the dispute was arbitrated and geely was forced to  |||  change  |||  it .
fashion house lacoste  |||  lost  |||  a suit in china against copycats from hong kong and singapore , who were using the famous crocodile looking in the other direction .
the chinese  |||  authorities  |||  are unaware of any wrongdoing .
in the past year , however , things reportedly " returned to normal following this  |||  emergency  |||  situation regarding the work flow . "
almost 57,000 such cased were closed , 75 percent more than in the  |||  previous  |||  year .
nonetheless , there are still 81,500 appeals  |||  waiting  |||  to be resolved in the office .
as is so often the case in china , the  |||  figures  |||  are imposing .
in the past year , more than 1.4 million applications for trademark  |||  protection  |||  were submitted to the ctmo , almost one third more than in 2010 .
this is a  |||  record  |||  and means that china , for the tenth time in succession , is the global leader when it comes to new trademark applications , informed the authority .
the same applies for the inventory of valid trademarks , totalling 5.5 million in  |||  number  |||  .
in 2011 , 1.8 billion yuan in  |||  fees  |||  were received .
put simply , this means that  |||  each  |||  application costs on average 1,280 yuan , or 160 euros .
to appeal against an application costs many times this amount , as can be seen in the case of the german family  |||  business  |||  , freudenberg .
for more than seven years , the group has been contesting against a  |||  chinese  |||  plagiarist .
the germans did in fact manage to expose the company 's  |||  illegal  |||  manufacturing of copied motor vehicle parts .
however , the copycat still secured the  |||  chinese  |||  rights to the freudenberg brand .
this is something we missed ourselves , as family names cannot be  |||  protected  |||  in germany , said hanno wentzler , chairman of the board of management at freudenberg chemical specialities in munich .
the ctmo trademark  |||  office  |||  then also dismissed the munich - based company 's appeal .
in the next two instances , freudenberg was proven  |||  right  |||  , however the opposing party continues to contest the matter to this day .
the  |||  matter  |||  is now pending before the supreme court .
however , he also says : " the process is extremely  |||  expensive  |||  and takes a lot of time , money and nerves . "
five years ago freudenberg unsuccessfully  |||  offered  |||  the opposing party a " high six - figure sum in euros " as settlement .
" this shows how much this is worth to us , "  |||  says  |||  wentzler .
the dangers in the far  |||  east  |||  even threaten to spilling over , back into europe .
particularly if imitators  |||  secure  |||  unprotected brand names there .
for example , a  |||  chinese  |||  manufacturer wanted to register the freudenberg label for shoes and leather in germany .
" you have to pay extremely careful attention , "  |||  says  |||  wentzler .
both he and pattloch advise companies to be very careful when conducting  |||  business  |||  with china .
it is not sufficient to rely on international trademark rights , rather foreigners should also register " everything " that is in any way  |||  worthy  |||  of protection in china as well , " said wentzler .
otherwise costs can be much more expensive than the  |||  registration  |||  fee .
in actual fact : if freudenberg were to loose at the final hurdle of its trademark drama , they would probably have to pay the opposing party license fees for the use of their own name ,  |||  explained  |||  wentzler .
world aids day : stomp , sing ,  |||  help  |||
in heidelberg , the imbongi choir is rehearsing - and in the swaziland , aids orphans are  |||  delighted  |||  .
first of all , the stamping : cowboy boots , basketball shoes , ladies ' pumps and men 's loafers attempt to find the beat on the parquet floor , and  |||  quickly  |||  do just that .
one - two - three -  |||  four  |||  .
it is monday evening and in the music room of the institute for  |||  medical  |||  psychology in heidelberg the imbongi choir are practising a new song .
the fifteen singers , aging from 23 to 69 years old , range from  |||  human  |||  geneticists to the maintenance man .
" om'obani " is by no means a simple piece , with each voice having a  |||  different  |||  text , and in an extremely foreign language at that : zulu , which is spoken by eleven million people in south africa , botswana , lesotho , malawi , mozambique and in parts of swaziland .
in swaziland , there are 245,000 aids  |||  orphans  |||  .
meanwhile , more than 40 percent of the  |||  population  |||  are hiv positive .
the voices for africa association has found sponsors in germany for 180 aids orphans in the  |||  village  |||  of esitjeni .
for 15 or 20 euros per  |||  month  |||  , you can become a sponsor .
this guarantees the child money for school , a school uniform and a  |||  warm  |||  meal each day in the gogo centre .
in zulu , imbongi  |||  means  |||  storyteller or worshipper .
in this region , no - one can  |||  speak  |||  the bantu language fluently , but they can sing it .
for almost ten years the choir has been practising songs in this foreign , ' soft ' language , and now and then they  |||  bring  |||  them back to where they originally came from : the south of africa .
for an 8,733 - kilometre flight  |||  away  |||  from heidelberg , in the north west of the swaziland kingdom , lies the village of esitjeni , which relies on the vocal power of the german choir .
forty  |||  percent  |||  are infected .
around 2,000 people live there , some still in  |||  simple  |||  mud and straw huts , and the majority of them are children .
more than 300 of them no  |||  longer  |||  have parents , as they succumbed to the hiv virus .
in esitjeni you get a small foreshadow of the illness from which all of swaziland is suffering : according to unicef , the region has the highest hiv infection  |||  rates  |||  and the lowest life expectancy in the world .
circumcision , which has been proven to  |||  reduce  |||  the risk of contracting the virus by half , is barely practised by the population .
without a school leaving certificate , there are barely any opportunities , particularly in a  |||  poor  |||  country .
initially it was the private commitment of individuals to  |||  send  |||  a child to school and enable him / her to have one warm meal a day for a few euros per year .
|||  facts  |||  on sexually transmitted infections .
what are the most important sexually transmitted  |||  diseases  |||  ?
who are the main  |||  affected  |||  groups ?
the robert koch institute understands that at least four in five of all syphilis cases  |||  reported  |||  in germany are transmitted by means of sexual contact between men .
among heterosexual adults , chlamydia infections , trichomoniasis , candidiasis ( fungal ) , gonorrhoea and  |||  human  |||  papilloma viruses are frequently occurring sexually transmitted diseases .
among young people , chlamydia infections are much more common than in other  |||  population  |||  groups .
according to european surveys , three quarters of all infections  |||  affect  |||  young people between the ages of 15 and 25 .
in this country ,  |||  human  |||  papilloma viruses are also frequently found in young people .
how has the number of infections  |||  developed  |||  ?
not all sexually transmitted  |||  diseases  |||  are notifiable .
according to the robert koch institute , the  |||  number  |||  of syphilis infections has more than doubled from 1,697 cases in 2001 , to 3,698 cases in 2011 .
in 2011 there were around 2,700  |||  cases  |||  .
which symptoms indicate a sexually transmitted  |||  disease  |||  ?
the infectious diseases can  |||  cause  |||  ulcers in the genital area , discomfort when urinating , discharge , lower abdominal pain and blisters or warts .
however , often they cause no pain or any other symptoms , thus  |||  remaining  |||  undetected .
how can you  |||  protect  |||  yourself ?
condoms can  |||  reduce  |||  the risk of contraction , however , they do not offer 100 % protection .
this is because occasionally , the pathogens of sexually transmitted diseases can also be passed on via smear infections and  |||  close  |||  bodily contact .
therefore , first and foremost experts recommend that people with frequently changing sexual partners undergo  |||  regular  |||  examinations .
if diagnosed early , the majority of stis can be cured and long - term consequences  |||  avoided  |||  .
through sponsorships donations and by no means least the funds that the choir raises across the  |||  whole  |||  of germany , the money all adds up .
" in  |||  total  |||  , we have already sent around 200,000 euros to esitjeni , " said annette lennartz , chairperson of the association .
in the  |||  village  |||  itself , zodwa dlamini , a self - assured and assertive woman , manages the money from germany .
she makes sure that the orphans have good accommodation , for  |||  example  |||  with one of their grandmothers .
the gogos , as the old ladies are called in zulu , are the pillars of the  |||  village  |||  .
some of them have up to 14 orphans living with them , providing them with a roof over their heads and making sure that the children get to their school classes punctually  |||  every  |||  day , in their school uniforms .
in addition , " voices for africa " has  |||  established  |||  a sewing school , built two chicken coops and , together with the american health organisation , psi , organised for many in the village to be tested for hiv .
this is nothing to be taken for  |||  granted  |||  , as is clearly the attitude towards illness throughout the entire country , the best way of keeping things under wraps is if people are dead .
a  |||  king  |||  with 14 wives
this is  |||  actually  |||  strange for a country in which the king officially has 14 wives .
among other factors , the fact that the hiv virus has  |||  spread  |||  quickly over the past number of decades can also be attributed to this officially sanctioned lifestyle .
another factor is the large number of migrant  |||  workers  |||  who carry the virus across the country .
there are free condoms on  |||  every  |||  corner , said annette lennartz , " but they are hardly used .
the  |||  culture  |||  prescribes otherwise - flesh to flesh . "
a bus  |||  full  |||  of white people , who sing songs in a black language - this degree of recognition brings not only morale and joy , but some grim - faced border soldiers even shed a few tears .
the journey always leads to esitjeni , where the singers  |||  visit  |||  their sponsor children .
even  |||  though  |||  you can barely find the small village on a map , it is more than well - known in the valley of the ezulweni river .
the messenger probe has found  |||  evidence  |||  of ice on the planet mercury .
the us space agency , nasa , has proven the existence of ice on the  |||  planet  |||  mercury .
although the planet lies closest to the sun , it does have frozen water - as  |||  shown  |||  in three studies published on thursday in specialist magazine " science . "
the water presumably  |||  came  |||  from comets or perhaps also asteroids that impacted with mercury .
however , no - one is linking the discovery of ice with the existence of  |||  life  |||  on the planet , said chief scientist for the messenger probe , sean solomon .
the temperature on mercury can  |||  reach  |||  up to 426 degrees celsius .
unknown to the majority of the earth 's inhabitants , there are probes , telescopes and  |||  small  |||  robots such as the phoenix , deployed to research the depths of the universe .
from time to time , they transmit images to earth :  |||  small  |||  peepholes into the infinite expanse .
this image comes from a camera  |||  developed  |||  by german researchers at the max planck institute .
the eight planets of our solar system , plus the dwarf  |||  planet  |||  ceres .
like pluto , which orbits  |||  around  |||  the sun behind neptune , ceres is not a planet according to the new definition of the term issued by the international astronomical union in 2006 .
this star - forming region - rather unromantically named w 5 by scientists - was discovered by the spitzer telescope in the cassiopeia constellation , at a distance of 6,500  |||  light  |||  years away .
this shimmering glow of a dying  |||  star  |||  was captured by nasa 's spitzer telescope .
the donut - shaped ring consists of  |||  material  |||  , ejected by the star in the process of dying .
in the huge trifid nebula , 5,400 light years away from the earth , new stars are  |||  created  |||  from gas and dust .
nasa 's spitzer telescope shot this  |||  photo  |||  of the galactic delivery room .
the pleiades star cluster , also referred to as " the seven sisters , " can be  |||  seen  |||  with the bare eye at night .
with the telescope , however , the  |||  colours  |||  really come into their own .
it is located 700  |||  light  |||  years away in the aquarius constellation .
its similarity with the continent resulted in this nebula acquiring the title ' north  |||  america  |||  ' .
this baby star could only be captured in its full  |||  beauty  |||  using the spitzer telescope 's infrared detectors .
perhaps they are the remnants of a  |||  moon  |||  of saturn , which disappeared without a trace 4.5 billion years ago .
depending on the colouring , photographs of spiral galaxies can  |||  become  |||  genuine works of art .
in the ophiuchus constellation , astronomers have photographed the signs of a cosmic collision : 400 million  |||  light  |||  years from the earth , the cores of two merging galaxies move rapidly towards one another , destined to collide .
anyone who does n't like technical abbreviations may prefer to  |||  call  |||  it by its nickname , the southern catherine wheel .
the photo taken by the hubble  |||  space  |||  telescope shows a section of the iris nebula in the cepheus constellation .
this  |||  image  |||  was put together from the x - ray images captured by various telescopes .
scientists  |||  call  |||  the larger spiral galaxy ugc 1810 .
this star nebula is home to the brightest group of  |||  young  |||  stars in our milky way .
in this bright shining galaxy with one small  |||  black  |||  hole , there exists no dust - only gas .
|||  researchers  |||  presume that it only came into being shortly after the big bang , when the universe was comprised primarily of hydrogen .
our view of the  |||  universe  |||  : the most important telescopes
the telescope is thought to have been invented in 1608 by hans lipperhey - even  |||  before  |||  galileo galilei used the device to observe the stars one year later .
for a period of 30 years , namely from 1947 until 1975 , the hale telescope in the palomar observatory  |||  near  |||  san diego was the largest telescope in the world .
the mirror , shown in the  |||  image  |||  , had a diameter of five metres .
it enables views of  |||  space  |||  via two mirrors , each with a diameter of 8.4 metres .
the inner workings of the gran telescopio canarias on the canarian island of la palma are huge - the mirror  |||  alone  |||  has a diameter of 10.4 metres .
the mirror of the southern african  |||  large  |||  telescope in south africa is segmented - to reduce costs .
in spite of this it achieves a diameter of  |||  around  |||  eleven metres .
the disadvantage of this inexpensive construction method : the telescope is securely clamped at its angle of inclination and its movement is therefore  |||  limited  |||  .
this - in spite of its comparatively low mirror diameter - even matches that of the world 's  |||  largest  |||  reflector telescopes .
with the  |||  help  |||  of a radio telescope in arecibo ( puerto rico ) researchers can listen for extraterrestrial signals in space .
in the " search for extraterrestrial intelligence " ( seti )  |||  every  |||  computer owner can be of assistance , by making his / her processing capacity available .
|||  view  |||  of the european southern observatory ( eso ) in the chilean andes .
this is home to the very large telescope , which lives up to its  |||  name  |||  .
with its  |||  total  |||  of four mirrors , the telescope can also focus on the medial infrared spectrum .
likewise to be located at the eso observatory in chile , the european extremely large telescope is also being  |||  planned  |||  .
its main mirror is to span a  |||  full  |||  42 metres and will be made from almost 1,000 mirror elements .
until 2007 , the two keck telescopes at the hawaiian volcano , mauna kea , were the largest in the  |||  world  |||  .
they each have two mirrors ,  |||  each  |||  with a diameter of ten meters .
another  |||  huge  |||  new telescope is also to be built on the mauna kea , with a mirror diameter of thirty metres .
since march 2009 the kepler  |||  space  |||  telescope has been searching for extra - solar planets , especially for any that may be inhabitable .
the image documents the  |||  final  |||  launch preparations on the kepler space telescope .
the james webb space telescope ( jwst ) will be launched into space on  |||  board  |||  an ariane5 rocket by 2018 at the earliest .
the primary  |||  mirror  |||  of the infrared space telescope has a diameter of 6.5 metres .
one of the telescope 's tasks is to search for  |||  light  |||  from the first stars and galaxies that emerged after the big bang .
scientists are assuming that ice also exists at mercury 's  |||  south  |||  pole .
however , there is no reliable data in support of this as the messenger orbits  |||  around  |||  the planets much closer to the north pole .
thanks to the messenger probe that was launched in 2004 , the first to orbit mercury ,  |||  scientists  |||  can now be certain .
there is even a museum of  |||  longevity  |||  .
a hunt for evidence in the country in which 97 years old is still comparatively  |||  young  |||  .
there is even a museum of  |||  longevity  |||  .
a hunt for evidence in the country in which 97 years old is still comparatively  |||  young  |||  .
the minibus rumbles over the winding streets , past densely wooded hills , raging rivers and  |||  simple  |||  farmhouses .
this is the home of the caucasian people group , the talysh , of whom not much is  |||  known  |||  except that they speak perfect persian and azeri and live long lives .
the small town is bursting with overpowering architecture from soviet  |||  times  |||  , which does n't fit with the picturesque mountain landscape at all .
tourists from europe rarely come here ; the journey from azerbaijan 's capital  |||  city  |||  , baku , is too arduous .
yet pilata fatulayeva ( 48 ) is convinced that lerik has what it takes to be a  |||  tourist  |||  attraction .
she is the director of the museum of  |||  longevity  |||  , most likely the only of its kind in the world .
here the lives of eight dozen talysh from the area who lived to older than 100 are documented . fatulayeva  |||  points  |||  out a black & white photo .
at the age of 136 he fathered another  |||  child  |||  .
however , the unrivalled star of the  |||  museum  |||  is shepherd shirali muslimov who is said to have lived to 168 years old .
and given that the longest confirmed lifespan was 122 years of age , muslimov 's claim  |||  seems  |||  extremely doubtful .
" he was born in 1805 , here in the region , and  |||  died  |||  in 1973 , " explains fatulayeva .
the man married three times and had 23 children , and is said to have fathered  |||  another  |||  daughter at the age of 136 .
so did shirali muslimov miscalculate his age by a  |||  couple  |||  of decades ?
but rembrandt scholz , researcher on ageing at the max planck institute in rostock , has also  |||  heard  |||  of people living to impressive ages in central asia .
" a strikingly high  |||  number  |||  of extremely elderly people can also be found in some areas of china , in japan or the hunza valley in pakistan , " said scholz , " while there is also an extremely large number of very old men in sardinia . "
due to lacking documentation , however , there is no  |||  scientific  |||  proof of age , particularly as there are no birth registers .
melted butter by the glass ,  |||  every  |||  day
however , the fact remains that the people of the region  |||  surrounding  |||  lerik reach a biblical age with striking regularity .
there are currently 20  |||  individuals  |||  older than 100 years of age .
so why do so many very old people  |||  live  |||  here in the south ?
the azeri travel  |||  guide  |||  farid mugimzadeh explains this as being due to the special talysh genetics .
however the notion that the calorie - rich diet of the talysh , who love meat , bread and especially dairy products , and of  |||  whom  |||  many drink a glass of melted butter on a daily basis , could be considered healthy from a nutrition science perspective does not really seem plausible either .
or is it the traditional way of life that keeps the people young ? in cengemiran , a tiny  |||  settlement  |||  not far from the town of lerik , lives rubaba mirzayeva .
at 97 years old she is still comparatively  |||  young  |||  for the area .
eight people  |||  live  |||  here under this roof , including one of mirzayeva 's sons and a daughter , both of whom have been grandparents for some time .
there are also two small  |||  children  |||  running around .
in the kitchen , tea is  |||  prepared  |||  for the guests , which is served in typical , bulging armadu glasses .
mirzayeva 's white teeth stand in perfect rank and file , beneath her headscarf she conceals  |||  long  |||  , dark blond plaits , which her son proudly reveals for us .
i have always washed my hair with milk , and it has never fallen out or lost its  |||  colour  |||  .
monthly  |||  pension  |||  is enough to live on
she has only ever eaten what she could get from her own farm - tomatoes ,  |||  potatoes  |||  , peas .
my  |||  whole  |||  life i have never once bought groceries in the supermarket .
then she tells of her husband who was in the  |||  army  |||  .
things were at their  |||  worst  |||  during the time after the second world war .
yet the cult that revolved around the father figure for the  |||  nation  |||  , who governed his country like a dictator practically knows no limits in azerbaijan .
mirzayeva receives 230 manat ( around the same sum in euros ) per month as her  |||  pension  |||  , which in a local context is an amount on which one can live comfortably .
and perhaps mirzayeva 's long greying son is right : " the elderly  |||  enjoy  |||  a deep respect in our culture . "
the notion of "  |||  human  |||  rights " is omitted from the constitution .
the revolution has returned to  |||  cairo  |||  .
the future constitution  |||  based  |||  on sharia law is fiercely disputed .
" and making sure it succeeds is my responsibility , before the people and before god , " he said on  |||  state  |||  television .
his  |||  speech  |||  was aimed at the entire population , however in particular at the coptic christians , the liberals , enlightened muslims and secularists .
for all of them , until now hopelessly estranged in a bewildered  |||  opposition  |||  , are fearful .
however , egyptians - and the world - are not entirely sure what the 61 - year - old engineer who holds a doctorate from the american university of southern california , really wants to  |||  save  |||  .
should the judiciary be deprived of  |||  power  |||  ?
as was also the case under  |||  previous  |||  constitutions , under the draft judicature is justified on the " principles of islamic law . "
yet what are "  |||  principles  |||  " ?
this is at least suggested by one newly added article : in all issues  |||  affecting  |||  sharia law , the al ashar university must be consulted , the country 's most important islamic institution , which has great influence throughout the whole of sunni islam .
much in the  |||  constitutional  |||  draft is open to interpretation
also problematic : civil  |||  military  |||  jurisdiction will continue to be upheld .
during mubarak 's  |||  rule  |||  , these courts served to suppress opposition .
according to the draft , the state should also protect " the true character of the egyptian family , and  |||  promote  |||  its morals and values . "
from a legal perspective , this is formulated in such an unclear manner that state institutions could even use this article to  |||  control  |||  the content of cinematic art and literature .
in plain  |||  language  |||  , this is nothing other than censorship .
incidentally , no article explicitly establishes the equality of men and  |||  women  |||  .
|||  another  |||  does prohibit the insult or slander of the prophet mohamed and his emissaries .
however , what constitutes an insult and how this should be sanctioned  |||  remains  |||  unclear .
|||  equally  |||  dubious is the formulation stating that " insulting people " is forbidden .
is a caricature of the  |||  president  |||  sufficient , or a joke at the expense of a jurist ?
open to interpretation , like so much in the draft submitted by mursi to be  |||  signed  |||  and that , in his own words , will be submitted to egyptians for referendum " very soon . "
" the revolution is  |||  back  |||  "
for  |||  weeks  |||  the opposition has been gathering to combat the superior strength of the islamists .
tens of thousands gathered on friday evening at the tahrir square in cairo , in unfamiliar unity , and pledged to bring down the charter  |||  before  |||  it has even come into effect .
" the revolution is  |||  back  |||  and we are going to be victorious , " said hamdin sabbahi , third place candidate in the presidential elections .
via sms service twitter , he accused mursi 's followers of  |||  wanting  |||  to lead " a coup against democracy . "
" if he calls for the  |||  referendum  |||  , we will go to his palace and overthrow him , " said member of the opposition jasser said .
" we have not yet grown tired , the blood of our brothers has not yet been atoned for , " stated the egyptian  |||  media  |||  , quoting opposition politician chaled ali .
and several judges have signalled that they do not want to oversee the  |||  referendum  |||  , which would render it invalid .
" the koran is our  |||  constitution  |||  "
the well -  |||  organised  |||  muslim brotherhood gathered for a counter - demonstration , although acting cautiously they did not choose the tahrir square but rather a mass prayer on the other side of the nile , outside the cairo university .
many veiled women and followers of the salafis took part , shouting out : " the people  |||  demand  |||  the application of god 's law . "
they demanded of mursi : " cleanse the country ! " and protested : " the koran is our  |||  constitution  |||  . "
a struggle for control over the symbolic tahrir square , where everything  |||  began  |||  , would have most likely provoked events verging on civil war .
quite clearly , this was something that mursi 's followers did not want to  |||  risk  |||  .
the muslim brothers  |||  stated  |||  that both those against and those in favour of the constitutional draft had expressed themselves loud and clear .
now is the time to let the population  |||  decide  |||  at the ballot box , in which direction the country should move forward .
it is a certainty that there is a  |||  majority  |||  in favour of the islamists ' draft .
" the term ' human rights ' does not even appear  |||  once  |||  "
the 48 - year - old human rights lawyer and chairman of the egyptian organisation for human rights ( eohr )  |||  defended  |||  the muslim brotherhood , when imprisoned or in court under mubarak .
not because he  |||  shared  |||  their world view , but because for him , human rights are indivisible .
for this he was battered ,  |||  condemned  |||  and imprisoned .
the lawyer has resigned himself to mursi  |||  extending  |||  his power to all three branches of state government .
these measures are blatant breaches of the ground rules of democracy and will guide egypt into a new  |||  dictatorship  |||  .
" instead of strengthening the  |||  civil  |||  society , the president is effectively suspending it , " complained saeda .
yet without  |||  civil  |||  society organisations , a democracy cannot function .
saeda feels abandoned , even by the international community , which is observing the  |||  battle  |||  over the ideological direction on the nile with a mixture of curiosity and excitement .
one demonstrator at the tahrir warned : " you are letting loose a monster that you can no longer  |||  control  |||  . "
norway 's rakfisk : is this the  |||  world  |||  's smelliest fish ?
could the secret of the country 's  |||  success  |||  be connected to the local appetite for some exceedingly smelly fish ?
place them in the midst of a pile of dirty , wet  |||  soccer  |||  kit .
|||  leave  |||  for a week .
i am in the  |||  small  |||  town of fagernes , about three hours from oslo .
rakfisk is trout sprinkled with salt and fermented in  |||  water  |||  for - depending on how smelly you like your fish - up to a year .
" you eat it raw , and then swallow a glass of aquavit , " says havard halvarsen , full - time local firefighter but also the so - called " rakfisk  |||  general  |||  , " in charge of running the festival .
all around us people are eating  |||  little  |||  cubes of the fish and knocking back quantities of drink .
" some people like the aquavit more than the rakfisk , "  |||  says  |||  havard .
if you can  |||  avoid  |||  passing it under your nose , it is not bad - not unlike a slice of sushi that has been on rather a long bus journey .
rakfisk is a product of very  |||  different  |||  , poverty - stricken times in norway when , pre - refrigeration , fish was soaked in airtight barrels of water and salt in autumn .
then in the depths of winter , well and truly fermented , it is taken out and - no  |||  doubt  |||  with the senses knocked out by alcohol - eaten .
only a generation ago , thousands of norwegians were forced to  |||  leave  |||  their country in search of work , emigrating mainly to the us .
now the population is expanding fast - more than 13 % are immigrants , attracted by plentiful jobs ,  |||  high  |||  wages and a comprehensive care system .
rakfisk is  |||  seen  |||  as signifying something important , a vital if rather smelly part of norway 's past .
it is among the more expensive  |||  dishes  |||  you can buy .
but then everything is  |||  expensive  |||  - a small glass of beer or a sandwich knock you back gbp 9 ( $ 14 ) each .
norway does not often make it on to the global news agenda - and most  |||  seem  |||  to like it that way .
people here are still loath to  |||  mention  |||  by name anders breivik , the right - wing , racist extremist who gunned down and killed 77 men , women and children last year .
instead , the shootings are referred to as " the july the 22nd  |||  incident  |||  . "
norwegians find it very difficult to  |||  believe  |||  that in their peace - loving country one of their own was capable of such brutality and murder .
the growth since the  |||  early  |||  1970s of one of the world 's biggest oil and gas industries lies behind much of norway 's present - day wealth .
" but oil is not the only reason we are doing so well , " says anna our waitress , handing round trays of maturing rakfisk and , with her  |||  long  |||  blond hair and startlingly blue eyes , the image of nordic well - being .
her  |||  english  |||  , like that of most people here , is flawless .
norway has handled its oil wealth very carefully - all but a small  |||  percentage  |||  of money from the industry is invested in a special fund for the benefit of future generations .
" as long as we can ski in winter and go hiking in summer we are  |||  happy  |||  , " says anna .
" and eat rakfisk , " she  |||  adds  |||  with a carefree laugh .
i  |||  stand  |||  in the snow and queue for something to eat - i have had enough rakfisk .
now an elk burger is certainly something  |||  different  |||  and rather succulent to the taste .
but in the evening , it is more of that smelly  |||  fish  |||  .
the hotel i am staying in is one of a  |||  number  |||  of venues hosting a rakfisk dinner where guests vote on the best - or perhaps the most nasally challenging - fish .
there is a live tv  |||  link  |||  up to a compere in a bow tie surrounded by plates of rakfisk .
" what score do you have for the best  |||  fish  |||  up there in the mountains thor - juergen ? "
a man falls off his  |||  chair  |||  , perhaps overcome with aquavit .
or maybe it is the fumes from all that  |||  fish  |||  .
|||  mexico  |||  's enrique pena nieto faces tough start
as mexico 's incoming president enrique pena nieto prepares to take office , the bbc 's will  |||  grant  |||  looks at the challenges facing him and the mixed expectations of his population .
traffic in mexico city is particularly bad at  |||  present  |||  .
a congested city at the best of  |||  times  |||  , a ring of steel has been erected since monday cutting off several key routes into the capital and causing chaos on the roads .
on saturday , mexico 's new president enrique pena nieto will receive the presidential sash and take over the  |||  running  |||  of the nation .
" my government has a great commitment to the mexican people to  |||  reduce  |||  the violence , " mr pena nieto told us president barack obama in the oval office earlier this week .
before rubbing shoulders with the us president , mr pena nieto 's previous political experience was as governor of his  |||  home  |||  state , the state of mexico .
in the bucolic town of valle del bravo , for  |||  example  |||  , he is remembered fondly .
residents credit him with boosting tourism in the resort and  |||  building  |||  infrastructure .
plaques bearing his  |||  name  |||  also hang outside a modern sports centre and an impressive interactive museum about climate change .
" we are looking to him to bring about  |||  real  |||  and lasting change , " says friend and political ally gabriel olvera hernandez , a state congressman for mr pena nieto 's party , the pri .
particularly in terms of security and the economy , we 're hoping for an interesting and  |||  true  |||  change which our country so badly needs .
after an unbroken 81 years in  |||  power  |||  , the pri was ousted in 2000 by vicente fox .
congressman olvera admits that after 12 years  |||  outside  |||  the presidential palace of los pinos , there is much expectation within the party about enrique pena nieto .
he 's a very straightforward man , very committed with an  |||  excellent  |||  vision of the country .
he 's an excellent statesman and ,  |||  above  |||  all , he 's someone who knows how to listen .
but on the other side of the state , that is not the impression many people have of their  |||  former  |||  governor .
in nezahualcoyotl , also  |||  known  |||  as ciudad neza , the contrast with the cobbled streets of valle del bravo could n't be sharper .
tucked away under motorway flyovers , it is in many ways a suburb of mexico city  |||  itself  |||  .
and the problems in the municipality are also gritty and  |||  urban  |||  .
on a patch of wasteland by a  |||  vast  |||  landfill site , the bodies of dozens of murdered women have been dumped over the past two years alone .
more than 1,000 women were  |||  killed  |||  in mexico state while mr pena nieto was governor , a rate much higher than in the notoriously violent city of ciudad juarez - a place synonymous with the murder of innocent women .
mr pena nieto 's critics say , at best , he  |||  failed  |||  to adequately address the problem of femicide while he was in office .
in a concrete  |||  home  |||  typical of the rundown neighbourhood , irinea buendia struggles to fight back the tears as she shows me photos of her late daughter , mariana luna .
according to the official version of events , mariana  |||  committed  |||  suicide in 2010 .
however her  |||  family  |||  believes she was murdered by her partner .
" when i arrived at her house it  |||  seemed  |||  her body had been washed , " senora buendia recalls .
as her mother recounts the story , a picture of mariana looks down from the walls , next to a cross bearing a  |||  single  |||  word : justice .
what they want is that one  |||  simply  |||  accepts what they say and shuts up .
" but that ca n't be  |||  right  |||  when there were so many irregularities and omissions , " she says .
as president pena nieto receives the sash on saturday , it comes with a heavy  |||  responsibility  |||  .
tens of thousands of families have been affected by violent  |||  crime  |||  in mexico over the past six years and the new president has promised to make them a priority during his time in office .
" i hope he 's the same kind of president as he was a governor , "  |||  says  |||  pri congressman olvera in valle del bravo .
that , however , is exactly what victims ' families in ciudad neza most  |||  fear  |||  .
the hearing focuses on manning 's time in the  |||  military  |||  brig at quantico , virginia
the army private is accused of stealing thousands of classified  |||  documents  |||
prosecutors tried to establish friday that army private bradley manning -- charged in the largest leak of classified material in u.s. history -- missed multiple opportunities to complain about the mistreatment he 's alleging he  |||  suffered  |||  in military custody .
the material was then  |||  published  |||  online by wikileaks .
wikileaks has never confirmed that manning was the source of its  |||  information  |||  .
when fein asked about the forms friday , manning  |||  acknowledged  |||  that he rated treatment by his guards as " excellent " and treatment by the facility overall as " very professional . "
manning responded that he would verbally express concern about issues and that the visiting officers would  |||  talk  |||  through the concerns and indicate that they would be addressed , but they did n't record the issues .
manning replied that his intention during that  |||  meeting  |||  was to get his " prevention of injury " status downgraded .
the military said they put him on this restrictive status -- a step below suicide watch -- for his protection and the safety of  |||  others  |||  .
" i wanted staff to know i was  |||  fine  |||  , and ( i wanted to ) get off the poi status ... to enjoy an increased quality of life from my viewpoint , " manning said .
manning testified thursday about his arrest in iraq and his transfer to kuwait , where he was  |||  held  |||  for nearly two months before being transferred to the brig at marine base quantico in virginia in july 2010 .
he said he contemplated suicide in kuwait and  |||  once  |||  passed out there due to the heat .
he said not being allowed to know what was  |||  happening  |||  to him or in the outside world was distressing .
" my  |||  world  |||  just shrink to camp arafjon , to that cage , " manning said thursday .
manning said he was  |||  allowed  |||  only a mattress , blanket , flip - flops , some clothes and his glasses .
manning said he always slept with  |||  light  |||  from outside his cell in his eyes .
if guards could not see his  |||  face  |||  when he rolled over at night , he said they would wake him to roll back over .
manning 's lawyer filed a formal objection to manning 's  |||  treatment  |||  in january 2011 .
manning was moved to the  |||  military  |||  prison at fort leavenworth , kansas , in april 2011 .
also friday , the judge asked manning about an allegation that he made in thursday 's testimony -- that after being forced to sleep naked one night in his quantico cell , he was forced to  |||  stand  |||  naked in front of guards and other inmates during a morning head count .
manning testified thursday that he was forced to sleep naked the previous night because of his attempt to  |||  show  |||  an officer that he was n't a danger to himself .
that night , manning testified , his underwear , flip - flops and glasses were  |||  removed  |||  from his cell .
his lawyers hope the judge will at least take his experiences during confinement into account and sharply  |||  reduce  |||  his sentence should he be convicted at his court - martial , which is expected to begin early next year .
the defense has said it plans to have manning plead guilty to lesser offenses and fight other charges as being too  |||  extreme  |||  .
the pentagon has maintained that manning was  |||  held  |||  in accordance with rules governing all maximum - custody detainees at quantico .
counts against manning  |||  include  |||  aiding the enemy , wrongfully causing intelligence to be published on the internet , transmitting national defense information and theft of public property or records .
my mexican -  |||  american  |||  identity crisis
he says many were forced to  |||  leave  |||  mexico because of the lack of opportunities there
mexicans tend to fault those who  |||  left  |||  ; they remind mexicans of hard times , he says
navarrette says  |||  mexican  |||  - americans are caught between two worlds
on a  |||  recent  |||  trip to mexico city , i had barely made my way down the concourse and arrived at the immigration processing area when i got stumped .
i  |||  stood  |||  there for a few seconds , unsure of where to go .
growing up in central california , i had been called a " mexican " my  |||  entire  |||  life .
later , i settled on " mexican -  |||  american  |||  . "
but , this was  |||  mexico  |||  .
i was simply an  |||  american  |||  .
i speak spanish , good enough to handle either end of an interview in that  |||  language  |||  .
but i do n't have the vocabulary of a native , and i ca n't shake my  |||  american  |||  accent .
so i took my u.s.  |||  passport  |||  and got in the line for extranjeros .
i  |||  thought  |||  about that moment this week when mexican president - elect enrique pena nieto visited the white house to meet with president obama .
on the agenda , as usual , when the leaders of these two countries  |||  meet  |||  : immigration , drugs and trade .
pena nieto was also eager to talk about the growth of the mexican economy , which is one reason that mexicans are now just as likely to  |||  stay  |||  in mexico as venture to the united states .
he wants to partner with the united states and canada , and create a  |||  european  |||  union - style trading bloc in north america .
and pena nieto vowed to continue mexico 's war against the  |||  drug  |||  cartels , even though he offered no specifics .
most americans probably never give a thought to the fact that , in 1848 , the united states invaded mexico and  |||  forced  |||  its leaders to sign over half their territory at the point of rifle .
but for mexicans , who think in terms of  |||  centuries  |||  , not minutes , the reminders are everywhere .
so the minute that a u.s. official says anything the least bit  |||  critical  |||  of mexico , you start hearing -- in the mexican press , and among the elites -- complaints about how the americans are encroaching upon their neighbor 's sovereignty .
and the  |||  children  |||  of montezuma go on the warpath .
and yet , for mexico , the really challenging relationship is with the more than 35 million mexican - americans  |||  living  |||  in the united states .
mexico has winners and losers , people for  |||  whom  |||  the country provides opportunities and others for whom it does n't .
the only reason you have so many people of mexican ancestry living in cities like los angeles , las vegas , phoenix , denver or san antonio is because , at some  |||  point  |||  in our family tree , there was a person , maybe a parent or grandparent , who was shut out from opportunity in mexico and had to go north .
and even though we may now be  |||  living  |||  the american dream , having gone to good schools and taken good jobs , we can never lose sight of the fact that it 's the american dream we 're living , and not the mexican one .
our identity  |||  might  |||  sometimes be fuzzy , but our loyalty is clear .
it 's to the united  |||  states  |||  .
besides , we 're  |||  aware  |||  that many of the elite mexicans in the ruling class do n't like us .
the feeling is  |||  mutual  |||  .
they see us as a reminder of a humiliating defeat and  |||  look  |||  down on us as inferior stock that is n't sufficiently mexican .
our spanish will never be good enough , our ties to mexico never  |||  strong  |||  enough .
our existence is , as they see it , all about  |||  failure  |||  .
my wife , who was born in guadalajara and came to the  |||  united  |||  states legally as a child , reminds me that there is friction between mexicans and mexican - americans because mexicans have a firmer grasp of who they are and mexican - americans resent that .
meanwhile , many mexican - americans i know do n't feel like they 're a  |||  part  |||  of either .
you get the best of both worlds , but you 're  |||  rooted  |||  in neither .
in mexico , we 're  |||  seen  |||  as americans .
and in the united states , we 're  |||  considered  |||  mexican .
now , to complicate the relationship even further , as i learned during my trip , some mexican  |||  leaders  |||  and parts of the intelligentsia want to reconnect with the diaspora .
we would tell our fellow americans what a great country this is to visit and pressure political  |||  leaders  |||  to strengthen ties with mexico .
that 's not going to  |||  happen  |||  .
that 's  |||  fair  |||  .
maybe we 're more " mexican " than i  |||  thought  |||  .
old battles , new  |||  middle  |||  east
the ceasefire between israel and hamas could yet be an unlikely  |||  foundation  |||  for peace
can there ever be a lasting peace between arabs and jews in the  |||  middle  |||  east ?
|||  another  |||  round of bloodshed suggests that any such hope is vain .
amid the usual futile arguments over who started it , scores of buildings have been reduced to rubble ; more than 140 palestinians , most of them civilians , and six israelis have been  |||  killed  |||  ; and , for the first time , missiles from gaza have landed near tel aviv , israel 's metropolis , and the holy city of jerusalem .
but though the israelis and palestinians  |||  seem  |||  stuck in their ancient conflict , all around them the middle east is changing .
the arab spring has thrown the pieces up in the air , and , like it or not , the palestinians and israelis are caught up in the regional  |||  turmoil  |||  .
maybe this will make their struggle bloodier than  |||  before  |||  .
the leaders of hamas , the islamist movement that has ruled gaza since 2007 , will claim to have  |||  forced  |||  the israelis to back off , even though gaza has taken a drubbing .
despite killing some of its  |||  leaders  |||  and bottling up gaza 's 1. 7m people in one of the most wretched and crowded corners of the planet , israel has failed to destroy hamas .
indeed hamas is gaining on the west bank , the other bit of palestine currently run by its bitter rivals in fatah , the more moderate  |||  palestinian  |||  faction .
moreover , hamas 's  |||  leaders  |||  may well conclude that time is on their side .
as islamists across the arab world have gained clout , so hamas has made  |||  powerful  |||  and rich friends .
turkey , a resurgent regional  |||  power  |||  that was once israel 's closest muslim ally , has taken up hamas 's cause ; so has qatar , one of the richest and most dynamic of the gulf states .
above all , on israel 's southern flank , the rise of the muslim brotherhood under president muhammad morsi in egypt , by far the most populous and pivotal of arab countries , has  |||  changed  |||  the region 's balance .
hosni mubarak , the secular despot who ran egypt for 30 years  |||  until  |||  his downfall in 2011 , had little time for hamas .
by contrast , the brotherhood is a cousin of hamas , and its  |||  leaders  |||  are more subject to popular opinion .
in future diplomacy hamas may emerge as an actor that cannot be shut out even by israel and  |||  america  |||  .
meanwhile , israel 's hardliners will draw the  |||  opposite  |||  conclusions .
israel 's iron dome anti - missile system has  |||  proved  |||  its worth and many of hamas 's missiles have been destroyed .
|||  israelis  |||  will sleep more soundly - for a while .
in diplomatic terms , america is as steadfast as  |||  ever  |||  ; many european countries also blamed hamas for starting the latest round of violence .
above all , israel has prospered , especially under binyamin netanyahu , a prime minister who has largely  |||  ignored  |||  the peace process .
why coddle those twisty palestinians by giving them a  |||  state  |||  of their own ?
if they really ran the west bank , would they not fire rockets , just as their compatriots have done in  |||  gaza  |||  ?
maybe the hardliners will win out ; yet the arab spring may  |||  change  |||  their calculations .
even if the islamists taking  |||  power  |||  in egypt and elsewhere have little love for israel , their priority will be tackling difficulties at home .
israel 's  |||  defence  |||  budget is bigger than that of its four arab neighbours combined .
|||  starting  |||  a war with the local superpower will hardly help the new arab governments mend their economies .
that the pragmatic mr morsi worked with barack obama to obtain a ceasefire augurs well - and  |||  might  |||  just mark the start of something .
israelis too should  |||  look  |||  to the longer term .
with the rest of the arab world becoming more democratic , depriving palestinians of their  |||  right  |||  to self - determination is creating a powder keg that is bound one day to explode in the territories occupied by israel - much as a bus exploded in tel aviv this week .
repression is already undermining democracy in the jewish state , and demography exacerbates this as the arab  |||  population  |||  swells .
bloody missions against gaza every few years to knock back hamas will exact a  |||  growing  |||  diplomatic toll .
both  |||  sides  |||  need prodding by outsiders
the answer remains the one trumpeted by  |||  sensible  |||  people on both sides , most of the outside world and this newspaper : two states , with israel ceding territory for security .
the hope - a small one in the short term - is that the ceasefire will give a little more leverage to outsiders pushing that  |||  cause  |||  .
egypt , which must now set about stopping the flow of arms into gaza , along with turkey and qatar , is better placed than ever to persuade hamas to accept the idea of a jewish state based on the 1967 boundaries with land swaps and a  |||  shared  |||  jerusalem .
|||  arab  |||  outsiders should also press hamas and fatah to come together .
that would do more to create a  |||  palestinian  |||  state than the imminent bid for virtual statehood at the un .
mr obama also has a part in getting israel to the  |||  table  |||  .
|||  back  |||  in the white house , he is looking just as reluctant to be drawn in .
america has a  |||  vital  |||  interest in a stable middle east .
that means a peace  |||  settlement  |||  between israel and the palestinians .
cigarette plain packaging laws come into  |||  force  |||  in australia
smoking warnings and diseased body  |||  parts  |||  emblazoned on dull green boxes that are the same for all tobacco brands
australia 's world - first laws on cigarette and tobacco plain packaging have come into force , replacing brand logos and colours with generic drab olive green coverings , gruesome pictures of diseased body  |||  parts  |||  and depictions of children and babies made ill by their parents ' smoking .
apart from the varying health warnings and images the only difference between the packs ,  |||  mandatory  |||  from saturday , are the brand names , and these are all printed in identical small font .
it is the  |||  world  |||  's most strict regime for the packaging of tobacco .
australia 's federal government says the aim is to deter  |||  young  |||  people from smoking by stripping the habit of glamour .
it is relying on studies  |||  showing  |||  that if people have not started smoking by age 26 there is a 99 % chance they will never take it up .
" even from a very early age you can see that kids  |||  understand  |||  the message that the tobacco company is trying to sell through their branding , " said the federal health minister , tanya plibersek , citing studies that showed , for example , children linking a crown in a logo with the idea of being a princess .
while australia has one of the world 's lowest smoking rates and the changes will have  |||  little  |||  impact on multinationals ' profits , other countries are considering similar steps .
the tobacco industry lobbied  |||  hard  |||  against the laws .
tobacco firms said they would  |||  boost  |||  black market trade , leading to cheaper , more accessible cigarettes .
" there will be  |||  serious  |||  unintended consequences from the legislation , " said scott mcintyre of british american tobacco australia .
others say the laws have boosted their  |||  business  |||  .
ha said zico had  |||  sold  |||  up to 6,000 to wholesale outlets and was awaiting new stock .
this is good  |||  business  |||  for us .
the potential hitch , experts say , is the popularity of social  |||  media  |||  with the very demographic the plan is targeting .
after a series of australian laws banning tv advertising and sports sponsorship and requiring most sellers to hide cigarettes from  |||  view  |||  , tobacco marketing has moved online .
" if you are a tobacco marketer and you 've only got this small window  |||  left  |||  to promote your products , online is the compelling place for you to be in , " said becky freeman , a public health researcher at sydney university .
freeman noted an increase in "  |||  average  |||  joe " reviews of brands on social media sites such as youtube , twitter and facebook .
we have to ask , is that just a private citizen who really loves marlboro cigarettes and they 've gone to the trouble of making a video , or is there a marketing company  |||  involved  |||  ?
the industry has gone as far as paying for ukraine , honduras and the dominican republic to challenge the new rules - the countries are claiming at the world trade organisation that trade is being unfairly restricted , despite none of the countries having  |||  significant  |||  trade with australia .
plibersek said the government had held discussions with other countries  |||  considering  |||  similar laws on packaging .
they now  |||  extend  |||  to more than 40 countries including brazil , turkey and ukraine .
tougher laws are being considered in britain , new zealand ,  |||  south africa  |||  and india .
many  |||  smokers  |||  in australia remain defiant .
the pictures do n't  |||  affect  |||  me .
honestly , there 's only one reason i 'd stop , and that 's my  |||  little  |||  girl .
james yu , who runs the king of the pack tobacconist in central sydney , said the  |||  uniform  |||  packaging made it harder to stack his shelves
" it used to take me an hour to unload a delivery , now it  |||  takes  |||  me four hours , " yu said .
in a constantly plugged - in  |||  world  |||  , it 's not all bad to be bored
i  |||  spent  |||  five unexpected hours in an airport this thanksgiving holiday when our plane had mechanical difficulties and we had to wait for another plane to arrive .
half a day in an airport waiting for a flight is pretty tedious , even with the distractions of books , magazines and iphones ( not to mention duty -  |||  free  |||  shopping ) .
but increasingly , some academics and child development experts are  |||  coming  |||  out in praise of boredom .
it forces the brain to go on interesting tangents , perhaps  |||  fostering  |||  creativity .
and because most of us are almost consistently plugged into one  |||  screen  |||  or another these days , we do n't experience the benefits of boredom .
first of all , like many people , i  |||  assumed  |||  that boredom was a relatively recent phenomenon , with the advent of more leisure time .
not so , says peter toohey , a professor of  |||  greek  |||  and roman history at the university of calgary in canada and the author of " boredom : a lively history " ( yale university press , 2011 ) .
" boredom actually has a very  |||  long  |||  history , " he said .
there 's latin graffiti about boredom on the  |||  walls  |||  of pompeii dating from the first century .
then there 's the question of how we  |||  define  |||  boredom .
after looking over the research literature and putting the idea in front of a focus group of about 100 people , professor eastwood and his colleagues  |||  defined  |||  boredom as an experience of " wanting to , but being unable to engage in satisfying activity . "
what separates boredom from apathy , he said , is that the  |||  person  |||  is not engaged but wants to be .
with apathy , he said , there is no urge to do  |||  something  |||  .
the  |||  core  |||  experience of boredom , he said , is " disruption of the attention process , associated with a low mood and a sense that time is passing slowly . "
boredom can sound an awful lot like  |||  depression  |||  .
sometimes we think we 're bored when we just have  |||  difficulty  |||  concentrating .
in their study , " the unengaged  |||  mind  |||  : defining boredom in terms of attention , " which appeared in the journal perspectives on psychological science in september , professor eastwood and his colleagues pointed to an earlier experiment in which participants listened to a tape of a person reading a magazine article .
some groups heard a loud and unrelated television program in the next room ,  |||  others  |||  heard it at a low level so it was barely noticeable , while the third group did n't hear the soundtrack at all .
the ones who heard the low - level tv reported more boredom than the other two groups - they had difficulty concentrating but were not  |||  sure  |||  why , and attributed that difficulty to boredom .
when you 're trying to  |||  focus  |||  on a difficult or engaging task , disruption of attention can lead to boredom , said mark j. fenske , an associate professor of neuroscience at the university of guelph in ontario and one of the authors of the study .
on the other hand , when you 're doing something dull , " such as looking for bad widgets on a factory line , distracting music can  |||  help  |||  you not be bored . "
in fact , he said , we now know that squirming and doodling , often  |||  seen  |||  as a sign of boredom , can actually help combat it by keeping people more physically alert .
" research shows that kids who are  |||  allowed  |||  to fidget learn more and retain more information than those who are forced to sit still , " professor fenske said .
we all experience boredom at some points - my flight  |||  delay  |||  , a droning speaker , a particularly tedious movie .
but some individuals are more likely to be bored than  |||  others  |||  .
to  |||  help  |||  measure this , researchers developed a " boredom proneness scale " in the 1980s .
the  |||  scale  |||  includes questions like , " many things i have to do are repetitive and monotonous , " and " i have so many interests , i do n't have time to do everything . "
|||  using  |||  such scales , researchers have discovered that boys tend to be bored more often than girls , said stephen vodanovich , a professor of psychology at the university of west florida , especially when it comes needing more , and a variety of , external stimulation .
in 1991 , reed larson , a professor of human and community development at the university of illinois ,  |||  conducted  |||  an experiment in which he contacted almost 400 teenagers and their parents seven to eight times a day by beeper .
he found that 32 percent of adolescents said they were bored in  |||  school  |||  and doing homework , while 23 percent said they were bored when they were n't in school .
on the other  |||  hand  |||  , 3 percent of parents said they were bored .
professor larson said he did not know whether the boredom percentages now , 21 years later , would be higher or  |||  lower  |||  .
but he said he did know that " adolescence is a peak period for boredom , "  |||  largely  |||  because children and teenagers are not given a lot of control over what they want to do .
so  |||  back  |||  to my original question : is boredom good for you ?
sometimes no , because in its extreme it can  |||  lead  |||  people to take absurd physical risks , gamble or indulge in substance abuse as a way to ease it , research shows .
on the other hand , many philosophers and writers discuss the connection between boredom and creativity , said professor vodanovich , who has been studying the  |||  issue  |||  for more than two decades .
" boredom is the brain 's way to tell you you should be doing something  |||  else  |||  , " said gary marcus , a professor of psychology at n.y.u.
but the brain does n't always know the most appropriate  |||  thing  |||  to do .
if you 're bored and use that energy to play guitar and cook , it will make you  |||  happy  |||  .
so if your child is bored and you give him an ipad , he may not be bored anymore , but he has n't learned how to entertain himself , or  |||  self  |||  regulate , professor fenske said .
and " that  |||  self  |||  - regulation transfers from one situation to other , " he said .
i do n't think we really want to  |||  celebrate  |||  boredom .
nor should we be too  |||  critical  |||  of it .
rather , our goal should be to  |||  feel  |||  comfortable away from the constant chatter of activity and technology .
professor eastwood  |||  agreed  |||  .
" we frame it as we need to be bored more , but boredom is an agonizing , restless desire to be  |||  connected  |||  with something meaningful , " he said .
what people are  |||  really  |||  searching for , he said , is a way to unplug and enjoy down time .
" in an environment where we are constantly overstimulated , " he said , " it 's  |||  hard  |||  to find ways to engage when the noise shuts down . "
anthony orozco , 19 , a community college student and soccer player in southeastern colorado , is facing  |||  criminal  |||  charges for something that will soon be legal across this state : the possession of a few nuggets of marijuana and a pipe he used to smoke it .
mr. orozco said that one day in september he and a few friends were driving in lamar , on the plains  |||  near  |||  the kansas border , when they were pulled over .
after the police officer found marijuana in the car , mr. orozco was issued a summons for possession and drug paraphernalia - petty offenses that each carry a $ 100  |||  fine  |||  - and given a court date .
in the uncertain weeks after colorado 's vote to legalize small amounts of marijuana for recreational use , the answer in hundreds of minor drug cases depends less on the law than on  |||  location  |||  .
hundreds of misdemeanor marijuana cases are already being dropped here and in washington state , which  |||  approved  |||  a similar measure .
police departments have  |||  stopped  |||  charging adults 21 years and older for small - scale possession that will be legally sanctioned once the laws take effect in the coming weeks .
at the same time , several towns from the denver suburbs to the western mountains are voting to block new , state - licensed retail marijuana shops from  |||  opening  |||  in their communities .
" this thing is evolving so quickly that i do n't know what 's going to  |||  happen  |||  next , " said daniel j. oates , the police chief in aurora , just east of denver .
regulators in washington  |||  state  |||  are also scratching their heads .
and they are looking for guidance on how to set up a system of licenses for production , manufacturing , distribution and  |||  sales  |||  - all by a deadline of dec. 1 , 2013 .
" colorado has a more regulated market , so they will be a good guide , " said brian e. smith , a spokesman for the washington state liquor control  |||  board  |||  .
but no place or system , mr. smith conceded , can do more than suggest what  |||  might  |||  work .
" there 's no  |||  real  |||  precedent for us to follow , " he said .
washington 's law , called i - 502 , takes  |||  effect  |||  on dec. 6 , which also leaves a year of limbo during which the state licensing system will not yet exist , but legalized possession will .
and there are thorny mechanical questions that must be resolved during that time , like how to balance the state 's mandate of "  |||  adequate  |||  access " to licensed marijuana with its prohibitions on cannabis businesses within 1,000 feet of a school , park , playground or child care center .
" nowhere will it be more difficult to site a licensed cannabis  |||  business  |||  than in urban areas , particularly in the seattle metropolitan area , " said ben livingston , a spokesman for the center for legal cannabis , a recently formed research group .
on nov. 21 , chief oates in aurora sent his officers an e-mail announcing that the city attorney would no longer be prosecuting small marijuana violations for anyone 21 years or older , and that the police would  |||  stop  |||  charging people for those crimes " effective immediately . "
chief oates said that the police would enforce city codes regulating  |||  medical  |||  marijuana growers , and that they would still pursue drug traffickers and dealers .
in northern colorado 's weld county , the district attorney , ken buck , represents a stricter  |||  view  |||  .
after the vote , he said his office would  |||  continue  |||  pursuing marijuana possession cases , mostly as a way to press users into getting treatment .
right now , 119 people  |||  face  |||  charges of possessing two ounces or less of marijuana , though many are facing other charges .
" our  |||  office  |||  has an obligation to prosecute offenses that were crimes at the time they occurred , " mr. buck said in a statement .
the response has been complicated even in places like rural mesa county , where voters  |||  rejected  |||  the marijuana initiative .
the police in grand junction , the county 's largest city , are no longer citing adults for possession of  |||  small  |||  amounts .
the county 's district attorney , pete hautzinger ,  |||  supported  |||  that decision , but also decided not to dismiss all of the pending possession cases .
" i do not think i 'm wasting my time  |||  continuing  |||  to enforce the law until it changes , " he said .
although 55 percent of colorado voters  |||  supported  |||  the measure , bringing recreational marijuana into the folds of government and the legal system was never going to be simple .
and the contradictory reactions  |||  across  |||  the state lay bare a deep ambivalence among local officials about the state 's big green experiment .
" it 's a cultural barrier " with district attorneys , said sean mcallister , a denver lawyer who represents marijuana defendants and is a local spokesman for the  |||  national  |||  organization for the reform of marijuana laws .
" they  |||  spent  |||  so much of their lives prosecuting people that they still do n't really accept that this is legal , " he said .
as the first states to treat small amounts of marijuana like alcohol , colorado and washington are poised to  |||  become  |||  national test cases for drug legalization .
as advocates and state officials plan for a new frontier of legalized  |||  sales  |||  , they are also anxiously awaiting direction from the federal government , which still plans to treat the sale and cultivation of marijuana as federal crimes .
advocates for legalized marijuana are hoping the  |||  justice  |||  department yields .
despite some high - profile arrests of medical marijuana patients and sellers , the federal government has mostly  |||  allowed  |||  medical marijuana businesses to operate in colorado , washington and 16 other states .
|||  several  |||  cities in colorado are not waiting for federal authorities to act .
even before election day , some local governments approved moratoriums on any new marijuana shops , even though it will be about a year before any can  |||  open  |||  .
|||  last  |||  week , the western city of montrose took up a six - month ban , and is likely to pass it next week .
" we do n't want to be put in a position where we license somebody and then have a big federal  |||  issue  |||  , " said bob nicholson , a city council member .
our community voted against this  |||  amendment  |||  .
we 're looking at what the community voted for versus what the  |||  state  |||  voted for .
petronella wyatt : i was bullied out of  |||  oxford  |||  for being a tory
it is not just today 's  |||  university  |||  students who are attacked for their views
i ca n't remember a time when i did n't dream of winning a place at oxford  |||  university  |||  .
the evening  |||  standard  |||  diary claimed i 'd quit because i objected to fellow undergraduates having sex in the room next to mine .
the writer a n wilson  |||  announced  |||  waggishly that i 'd departed because i was forced to drink out of chipped mugs .
the truth was  |||  less  |||  droll .
yes , ran , because i had been  |||  subject  |||  to systematic bullying and intimidation .
not on account of my rather outré name , or the fact that i  |||  came  |||  from a private school .
i was persecuted for one reason only , and in this cradle of supposed enlightenment it was both bigoted and barbaric : my father , the  |||  late  |||  woodrow wyatt , was a high - profile adviser to margaret thatcher and i was a conservative supporter .
well , recent reports suggest that a new generation of  |||  right  |||  - of - centre students are suffering a similar persecution .
such is the institutionalised and  |||  increasing  |||  hatred of tory students at oxford that last week a group of them demanded the same equal - rights protection as gays , disabled people and ethnic minorities .
conservative  |||  members  |||  of corpus christi college 's junior common room ( jcr ) claim they are " often actively isolated , personally attacked and made to feel unwelcome " because of their political views .
they want to create a post on the college 's  |||  equal  |||  opportunities committee to ensure that their opinions can be aired freely .
their situation was n't helped by a recent bbc two documentary , wonderland : young , bright and on the  |||  right  |||  , about student politics , which portrayed tories as oddballs and neo - nazis .
it featured graduate joe cooke , former president of the oxford  |||  university  |||  conservative association ( ouca ) , travelling in a rolls - royce , sporting a silver suit and silver - topped cane .
at other  |||  universities  |||  , conservative students say they are being treated as " scapegoats " for the introduction of higher tuition fees . "
luke black , 20 , vice - president of nottingham  |||  university  |||  conservative association , told a sunday newspaper that " there is a growing left - wing bias at universities .
samuel roberts , 21 , a history student at corpus christi , who proposed the motion for greater protection , says such a climate is " uncomfortable , " while stephanie cherill , 19 , president elect of ouca , says there has been a deterioration in the attitude of jcr members towards people who are  |||  right  |||  of centre .
" this poses a threat to the atmosphere of intellectual discussion , as well as to the welfare of  |||  members  |||  , " she says .
i was in a  |||  minority  |||  of one during my first few weeks at oxford .
hatred of the conservative  |||  party  |||  was at its most febrile .
the year before , the  |||  university  |||  had voted to refuse margaret thatcher - a former student - an honorary degree , because of cuts in higher education funding .
the  |||  atmosphere  |||  would have made a stalinist shudder with apprehension .
during the first few  |||  days  |||  of freshers " week , when new students socialise with each other and the dons , i had a taste of the wormwood that was to come .
" miss wyatt , " said the don , harry pitt ( now deceased ) , " please translate the first  |||  paragraph  |||  . "
a small man with a  |||  face  |||  like cake batter , pitt was big on bile .
" do thatcherites refuse to learn  |||  french  |||  or are they just stupid ? " he demanded .
" i  |||  suggest  |||  you take some basic french lessons in your spare time - that is , if you 're not too busy socialising , " pitt snarled .
i walked  |||  back  |||  to my rooms a disconsolate figure .
it was a  |||  second  |||  - year english student named james who introduced himself as a member of the ouca .
|||  anyone  |||  suspected of being a tory is picked on .
it 's bad enough for me , but they know your father is  |||  close  |||  to margaret thatcher , so it will be worse for you .
|||  later  |||  , at a local pub , i cravenly attempted to dissimulate .
i insisted that i did n't agree with  |||  everything  |||  mrs thatcher said .
this ploy  |||  proved  |||  unsuccessful .
a first  |||  year  |||  ppe student , who , ironically , had been to eton , said : " you 're the daughter of a fascist pig . "
i was perverted ,  |||  dirty  |||  .
they beat  |||  each  |||  other , do n't they ?
i  |||  felt  |||  the way homosexuals must have felt before the liberal legislation of the sixties .
would i  |||  ever  |||  be able to lead a normal life at oxford ?
would i be  |||  forced  |||  to meet like - minded people only after dark ?
would i have to  |||  turn  |||  to labour and suppress my natural inclinations ?
the three years  |||  before  |||  me stretched out as a purgatory of ostracism and isolation .
he was  |||  hardly  |||  ever there .
he loathed the place as provincial and petty , and for its adherence to the marxist - determinist  |||  view  |||  of history .
in 1997 he took up a professorship at the  |||  university  |||  of bilkent , in ankara , turkey .
" you wo n't be  |||  happy  |||  here , " he told me .
i  |||  began  |||  commuting from oxford to my parents " house in london , finding refuge with my more open - minded metropolitan friends and family .
i  |||  told  |||  my father i hated oxford and why .
during his time there in the forties , all political views had been  |||  accepted  |||  .
" but it 's the best place in the  |||  world  |||  , " he said pathetically .
even my  |||  communist  |||  friends always had impeccable manners .
his rheumy  |||  eyes  |||  began to cloud .
i 'm  |||  sure  |||  it 's all just a tease .
exhausted by my frequent trips to london , my emotional  |||  resistance  |||  was deteriorating .
a male friend of  |||  mine  |||  , also a tory supporter , had succumbed to pressure and renounced his creed .
during a tutorial the following week , when another history don had suggested , in  |||  complete  |||  seriousness , that i was an " enemy of the people , " i decided to do the same .
inwardly blushing with shame , i  |||  admitted  |||  to being " brainwashed by my parents " and called them " old fools . "
it was my father who drove the nail into the coffin of my oxford  |||  career  |||  .
at the time , he wrote two columns in the murdoch press  |||  each  |||  week .
my  |||  door  |||  was locked .
i cowered  |||  inside  |||  , and after five minutes , my pursuers gave up .
when they  |||  left  |||  , i packed a suitcase and caught the first train to london .
but no 18 - year - old should be  |||  subject  |||  to such intimidation and vitriol in an educational institution .
" valentino prefers  |||  elegance  |||  to notoriety "
somerset house , former home of queen elizabeth i of england , is the only place in the  |||  british  |||  capital worthy of hosting a valentino garavani exhibition .
during the inauguration of " valentino : master of couture , " the designer acknowledged a retrospective apotheosis that brings together over 130 couture gowns  |||  created  |||  by his fashion house over the past 50 years .
" i love this palace " he says , in his unmistakable  |||  italian  |||  accent .
valentino has always been fascinated by the rarefied and  |||  distant  |||  world of the nobility .
valentino exhibits these personal memories as if they were trophies of his  |||  social  |||  ascent from humble couturier in voghera , northern italy , to idol of the international jet - set .
there is nothing  |||  wrong  |||  with loving royalty .
" at least they do n't drop cigarette ends on your magnificent carpet , like some  |||  beautiful  |||  pop music celebrities do , " says baroness fiona thyssen - bornemisza .
in the '60s and '70s , we both  |||  lived  |||  in the alps and were good friends .
" we all loved being invited to his chalet in gstaad " says " heini " thyssen 's ex - wife , a  |||  close  |||  friend of forgotten beauties such as marella agnelli and eugenie niarchos .
valentino has always preferred  |||  elegance  |||  to notoriety .
the  |||  argentine  |||  model valeria mazza also recalls the couturier 's charisma .
many years ago , after a fashion show in piazza di spagna in rome , we  |||  went  |||  for dinner at his flat .
you could see and  |||  feel  |||  his " spirit " in every detail of the flat and its decor , the food and the music .
" all the guests were made to  |||  feel  |||  important and loved " recalls the top model , who started working with him during haute couture week paris , in 1995 .
garavani 's  |||  life  |||  is not a story of obsession , but of well reciprocated love .
he loves well - educated people who come from good backgrounds , and they  |||  love  |||  him .
in this crowd of mannequins ,  |||  names  |||  stand out such as sibilla of luxembourg , gloria von thurn und taxis , mette - marit of norway , rosario of bulgaria and sofia of habsburg .
many of these clients say your first valentino is like your first  |||  love  |||  , " impossible to forget . "
i remember it  |||  perfectly  |||  .
it was a pair of trousers , a shirt , a " gilet " waistcoat and jacket from the 1971-1972 autumn - winter  |||  collection  |||  .
" i prefer him to other designers because of his femininity , his great love of women , and because he enhances our beauty " added the  |||  former  |||  duchess of feria .
i love the colours he uses , they really stand out and " lend themselves " to your  |||  face  |||  .
their proportions are  |||  perfect  |||  .
the princess and  |||  fashion  |||  advisor patricia della giovampaola d'arenberg also remembers the first time she wore a valentino .
as a teenager  |||  living  |||  in italy , i dreamed of reaching the age when i 'd have the chance to wear one of his evening gowns ...
it was a red  |||  dress  |||  , with a frilly skirt , draped " corsage " and a strapless neckline .
" it was a dream come  |||  true  |||  " says princess d'arenberg , the widow of rodrigo d'arenberg .
" valentino is indifferent to fashion , his obsession is timeless " says this  |||  italian  |||  aristocrat who lives between paris , new york and buenos aires .
the "  |||  king  |||  " of fashion
the " grand finale " of the somerset  |||  house  |||  exhibition is marie - chantal miller 's wedding dress from her marriage to paul of greece in 1995 .
it took four months ' work and 25 " girls " ( as the designer calls his seamstresses ) to create the pearl - encrusted , ivory - coloured silk gown with twelve  |||  different  |||  types of lace and a train four and a half metres long .
according to journalist suzy menkes , the leading authority of the specialist press , that dress represents a high fashion milestone of the late 20th century , " the  |||  return  |||  of high society clients . "
" i 've always been struck by his refined and calm manner , and his neat and  |||  perfect  |||  appearance " acknowledges d'arenberg .
the last time i saw him was a month ago at a gala dinner at the orsay  |||  museum  |||  .
if a princess  |||  says  |||  that ...
this is the case of anto wijaya , one of the 400 miners who make their  |||  living  |||  taking sulphur from the kawah ijen volcano , east of the indonesian island of java .
to do so , he has to descend  |||  every  |||  day to the bottom of the crater , where the sulphurous gas emanating from the bowels of the earth solidifies on contact with air .
after breaking off large sulphur rocks , which in  |||  total  |||  can weigh up to 70 kilos , he carries them in two bamboo baskets on his shoulders along the steep stone paths .
it is only 250 metres to the top of the volcano , which rises to 2,386 metres above sea level , but the exhausted porters take over 40 minutes to get there , at snail 's pace ,  |||  keeping  |||  their balance and measuring their steps carefully to avoid slipping and falling over the precipice .
they know that one slip could cost them their lives , as happened to a  |||  french  |||  tourist who plunged to her death a few years ago on the hazardous kawah ijen cliffs .
once at the top , they make their way past the tourists who photograph them like circus monkeys and then , lugging their heavy baskets , they walk three kilometres to the scales installed by a mining company a  |||  little  |||  further down , 1,850 metres above sea level .
this is pt ngrimbi candi , a company which , since 1960 , has been exploiting the volcano , and quite literally its  |||  workers  |||  , whom it pays 662 rupees ( 5 euro cents ) per kilo of sulphur .
it then sells the sulphur for 10,000 rupees ( 83 cents ) to the petrochemical industry , as the mineral is widely used in everyday  |||  life  |||  and is used in the manufacture of matches , fireworks , cosmetics , dynamite and even for whitening sugar .
" we generally carry 70 kilos , so we get about 46,000 rupees ( 3.8 euros ) a  |||  trip  |||  " explains anto , who usually make three trips a day .
each one  |||  takes  |||  three hours and you end up exhausted , but it means he gets 138,000 rupees ( 11.5 euros ) at the end of the day .
|||  although  |||  it seems a pittance for such an inhuman effort , it is three times what he would earn in the field .
" miners ' wages are very high here , whereas coffee harvesting is  |||  paid  |||  15,000 rupees ( 1.2 euros ) a day and the average monthly wage is two million rupees ( 167 euros ) " explains the porter , who previously worked as a mason in the island resort of bali .
there , his wage was 75,000 rupees ( 6.2 euros ) a day and the work was not as  |||  hard  |||  , but anto has returned with his family to banyuwangi , a village near the volcano , for a compelling reason which , in indonesia , is as overriding as the sulphur : " i married a girl from bali , where they are hindu , and i 've brought her to java to convert to islam . "
anto has asthma , he has difficulty breathing , coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the  |||  toxic  |||  gases .
at 27 years old , anto has been risking his life for three years in the kawah ijen volcano , and the sulphur has already begun to take its toll on him , even though he covers his  |||  face  |||  with special mask and goggles .
he has asthma , he has difficulty breathing , coughs constantly and his eyes are irritated by the  |||  toxic  |||  gases from the volcano .
this is the  |||  price  |||  you have to pay to realise your dreams .
" i 'll go on working two more years because i want to  |||  open  |||  a shop or study spanish or french " he vows in more than acceptable english .
punished for life , this pleasant , intelligent young man could be a tour guide , waiter or hotel receptionist , but  |||  instead  |||  he does the work of a mule .
sharing a filthy wooden hut with other porters , he gets up  |||  every  |||  day at two in the morning because the sulphur does n't stop flowing at night , when its characteristic yellow colour turns blue and it glows in the dark .
defying the shadows , anto descends the crater and lights the path with a  |||  small  |||  torch attached to the helmet he bought with his money .
despite their huge profits , the mining company has not mechanised the sulphur extraction process to  |||  save  |||  costs , nor has it provided any equipment for the porters , who work for themselves and by the kilo .
in fact , they do not even see any of the 30,000 rupee ( 2.5 euro ) per camera surcharge that , on top of the 15,000 rupee ( 1.2 euro ) entrance fee , the guards of this  |||  natural  |||  reserve charge to tourists who come to photograph the volcano and their human mules .
he can lift up to 110 kilos , ensuring that he will go on  |||  working  |||  " all he can " because he needs the money to educate his three children , aged between 18 [ months ? ] and 10 years old .
i wo n't retire , i 'll die here because the volcano has been my  |||  whole  |||  life .
although the sulphur burns your throat and stings your eyes when the wind suddenly changes and traps the miners in the thick columns of smoke coming out of the volcano , they are so hardy that no - one complains of  |||  serious  |||  illnesses ... apart , of course , from their common respiratory problems , osteoarthritis , knee pain and sores on the shoulders , which have been misshapen by the weight of the baskets .
" i wo n't retire , i 'll die here because the volcano has been my  |||  whole  |||  life " says unainik , opening a mouth full of gaps where teeth use to be .
time passes , but poverty perpetuates from generation to generation in one of the hardest jobs in the  |||  world  |||  : the one done by human mules in the kawah ijen volcano .
singapore seeks babies to save its  |||  economy  |||
" singapore 's population needs to  |||  grow  |||  . "
it may seem unlikely that these verses are  |||  part  |||  of an advert for mint sweets , but in spite of this - or perhaps because of it - the video went viral on youtube in singapore earlier this year .
the phrases are part of a rap and make use of local references such as " let 's put a bao ( bun ) in the oven " to make fun of the birth  |||  rate  |||  in singapore .
the advertising company that made the video , bbh , is hopeful that the advertisement will  |||  manage  |||  to focus attention to the problem in a fun way .
it 's purely an  |||  internet  |||  thing , so we had to make it fun and amusing .
it 's the biggest problem facing this  |||  country  |||  .
we are the world 's worst at reproducing our own progeny , so we felt it was an  |||  issue  |||  we had to address .
we knew the government had  |||  tried  |||  many things , like launching perfumes with pheromones or organising speed dating evenings .
many of these  |||  ideas  |||  may have been creative , but they did n't necessarily work .
1.2  |||  children  |||
but the singapore  |||  government  |||  is not taking it so lightly .
it  |||  spends  |||  usd 1,300 per year on policies to encourage people to have more children .
a government package for marriages and parents grants up to usd 15,000 per child , extends maternity leave and distributes tax  |||  benefits  |||  .
but this has all had  |||  little  |||  effect .
singapore is a rich , high technology city state in southeast asia , also known for the conservatism of its  |||  leaders  |||  and its strict social controls .
the  |||  birth  |||  rate in singapore , according to its national population division , currently stands at 1.2 children per woman .
the last time it was over 2 , known as the replacement  |||  rate  |||  , was in 1976 .
so why are singaporeans not having  |||  children  |||  ?
" this has given people a wider range of options in  |||  terms  |||  of life goals and priorities , beyond getting married and starting a family " he explains .
these changes in social norms have contributed to  |||  increasing  |||  numbers of people who are single , and delaying marriage and births , which has resulted in a decrease in the birth rate in singapore .
meanwhile , an eu immigration policy aimed at dramatically  |||  increasing  |||  immigration to cope with the population decline has created resentment among the local population .
in singapore , there are websites where xenophobia against many new immigrants is widespread and thinly disguised , especially the  |||  chinese  |||  who are criticised for keeping wages low and not integrating .
|||  increased  |||  immigration is also seen as one of the reasons why , last year , the singapore ruling party experienced its worst election result since independence .
since the election there has been an attempt to correct the problem , with the highest taxes and levies for foreign  |||  workers  |||  .
|||  unexpected  |||  consequences
while a fall in the birth  |||  rate  |||  has known effects on a nation 's economic growth , tax revenues , healthcare costs and immigration policies , in singapore 's case there are also some unexpected consequences .
the government is  |||  trying  |||  not to build so many small houses .
for example , it has started to  |||  influence  |||  the real estate sector .
its urban development authority has started to control the number of small apartments , known as " shoe boxes , " which can be  |||  built  |||  in certain areas of the city .
however , there is  |||  concern  |||  that they may promote a single - living lifestyle and discourage developers who want to build large family houses .
but , lim yew soon , managing director of the real estate  |||  company  |||  el developers , says his " shoe boxes " sell much faster than larger units .
they are more  |||  popular  |||  , in the sense that the units sell days , even weeks , faster than larger units .
this means they are much better for our  |||  cash  |||  flow .
singapore is a city  |||  state  |||  .
although these new rules may be a step towards increasing the national birth  |||  rate  |||  , when talking to singaporeans working in the central financial district , it seems they will not have much impact .
other people can have  |||  children  |||  .
" but , for me , it is important to have my own money and time " says  |||  another  |||  young man of around 20 years old .
men and women alike  |||  mention  |||  their careers , stress and the cost of property and education as the reasons preventing them from having children .
what is  |||  private  |||  offline is private online
|||  privacy  |||  .
according to the  |||  spanish  |||  royal academy dictionary , it means the quality of private life or " the level of privacy which a person is entitled to protect from any interference . "
what is  |||  privacy  |||  for an under 16 ?
how do you apply this definition to their  |||  daily  |||  life and social networks ?
do they  |||  understand  |||  the dangers they are exposed to by airing information over the internet which they probably would not share offline ?
elperiódico interviewed five children aged between ten and 15 years old who are  |||  frequent  |||  internet users .
in four cases , they associated the  |||  term  |||  with " something very much mine " on a personal level , and " in the user name and password " when applied to social networks .
" i would n't upload my deepest secrets in a post " says jorge , aged ten , when trying to explain the meaning of privacy on  |||  sites  |||  such as facebook , twitter , hotmail and windows live messenger , with which he has had accounts for two years .
" they are very secret secrets , i 'll tell my mother , but not everybody " he  |||  says  |||  .
on fb i upload nice  |||  pictures  |||  or games .
the child recognises that it is bad to post obscene pictures of naked people , crimes , or  |||  write  |||  humiliating or aggressive comments .
jorge  |||  says  |||  he knows the 35 friends he has on fb and his nine followers on twitter .
most are  |||  relatives  |||  .
" i do n't know if they  |||  answer  |||  me , i only upload them " he adds .
" social networking is fun , i can  |||  talk  |||  quickly to relatives far away or my friends " he says .
the case of joseph , aged 14 , is  |||  different  |||  .
this teenager has accounts with hotmail , facebook , my space and ask , and in the  |||  last  |||  case he admits not knowing 20 of the people added to his friends list .
" it does n't bother me , because we have something in  |||  common  |||  , like music " he says .
an acquaintance of a friend of mine was being pestered on a  |||  social  |||  network .
the victim , according to josé , did not close his  |||  account  |||  .
" he just made it  |||  private  |||  . "
he then explains a series of steps to  |||  configure  |||  the account safely .
unlike jorge , this boy would upload photos of acquaintances in uncomfortable or embarrassing  |||  situations  |||  .
i would do it if i did n't like  |||  somebody  |||  , or they made me want to do it .
key  |||  questions  |||
marielos porras , an english teacher with a degree in education and learning , believes that to guide children and teenagers , they should  |||  understand  |||  that the purpose of social media is to inform .
" the internet emerged as a means of searching for information , but with the appearance of these websites , the rules of the game  |||  changed  |||  " he says .
porras says the scholar marc prensky , with a master 's degree in education from yale university and author of the work digital natives , digital immigrants , coined these  |||  terms  |||  to explain the phenomenon .
digital natives are those children and  |||  young  |||  people born with technology .
" we are the digital immigrants who have to teach them , when we are still in fact learning " he  |||  says  |||  .
he says that the issue is complex , " because we are asking them to have a clear policy on what is  |||  appropriate  |||  or not to disclose , publish or divulge , at an age at which maturity is not conducive to this . "
"  |||  telling  |||  them not to do it is no good " he adds .
porras then  |||  lists  |||  some options : there are things you would n't tell a stranger , so why do it online ?
do you know what  |||  others  |||  publish about you ?
and one more question : does  |||  everyone  |||  need to know what you 're doing all the time ?
another  |||  point  |||  is to make them see that they must behave online as they do offline .
the  |||  rules  |||  are the same .
" outside the internet , people act with  |||  respect  |||  , morality and other principles , so they should act the same way on social networks " he says .

stuart guard , a university professor , primary school teacher and educational consultant , says it is essential for parents to  |||  read  |||  social networks ' policies thoroughly .
" for example , the age at which you are allowed to  |||  share  |||  or publish " he says .
according to guardia , it is important to remind  |||  children  |||  the " do n't talk to strangers " lesson .
efe repeatedly tried to gain access to the document signed at the sixth unasur meeting of heads of state and government , but presidential and chancellery sources initially said they would deliver it after the summit closed , but later they claimed that it will be  |||  published  |||  at some point on the peruvian government website .
when asked about the text , they pointed out that the content had been disclosed by peruvian president , ollanta humala , during a  |||  brief  |||  statement to the press .
journalists ' access to information from the summit was  |||  restricted  |||  at all times .
|||  last  |||  october , peru hosted the third summit of south american - arab countries ( aspa ) , and this time , despite repeated requests from the press , the previously announced lima declaration was again not made public .
the aspa official website confirms that the document was  |||  published  |||  last tuesday .
the presidents of peru , ollanta humala , and chile , sebastián piñera , met during the regional event and confirmed that they will  |||  respect  |||  the decision of the international court of justice ( icj ) , which on monday , at the hague , will start to hear the arguments of both parties , in the lawsuit lima has filed against santiago .
" chile has been , is and will remain a country that respects international law and the  |||  peaceful  |||  resolution of disputes , treaties and international courts " added piñera , greeting humala with a handshake , alongside the flags of the two countries .
confirmation of both presidents that they would submit to the icj came after colombia this week denounced the bogotá pact , whereby it  |||  accepted  |||  to submit to the judgement of this international court , following a decision on its maritime boundary with nicaragua which it regarded as seriously flawed .
the summit was held with the absence of the  |||  presidents  |||  of brazil , dilma rousseff ; venezuela , hugo chavez ; bolivia , evo morales ; and argentina , cristina kirchner .
paraguay , which was suspended by unasur in 2011 after the dismissal of former president fernando lugo , was not involved in the  |||  meeting  |||  .
host president ollanta humala was responsible for  |||  opening  |||  the session in the morning and closing the summit , just after noon in lima .
the president read the final document which reported that 16 agreements were  |||  adopted  |||  and the action plans laid down for 31 projects between the south american countries , for a total of 17 billion dollars of investments .
among the resolutions adopted , it was  |||  mentioned  |||  that unasur countries will take " important steps toward the goal of a south american citizenship , for which residence agreements are being extended . "
he  |||  reported  |||  that actions are being implemented to improve " cooperation in the fight against insecurity and transnational organised crime , actions to make medication more accessible , low - cost internet access in all areas of south america , and to deal jointly and efficiently with risks of natural disasters . "
with europe in crisis , "  |||  economic  |||  consolidation ( in latin america ) should not have a triumphalist attitude but should serve to expand its productive matrix and glimpse a better future for its people " humala added .
among these projects , he  |||  mentioned  |||  that five are in peru and are located in the transverse axes of its territory , between the coast and brazil , and two focus on increased connection with ecuador , although he gave no further details .
" we hope the electoral process in that country serves to reincorporate it in the union of south american nations , " from which it is  |||  currently  |||  excluded .
the need for latin america to remain a prosperous ,  |||  peaceful  |||  and integrated nation , with good neighbourly relations , was another issue highlighted by the summit .
in this sense , the president of colombia , juan manuel santos , said before attending the start of the regional event that he expected to  |||  meet  |||  with his counterpart from nicaragua , daniel ortega , on saturday in mexico , to respectfully discuss the maritime dispute after the failure of the icj , questioned by bogota .
" the day after tomorrow ( saturday ) i  |||  might  |||  have a meeting with president daniel ortega " santos said .
" with president ortega , i hope i can say that we handle this in the most civilised and respectful manner  |||  possible  |||  " said santos .
santos and ortega are due to  |||  meet  |||  on saturday in mexico , where they expect to attend the inauguration of the country 's new president , enrique peña nieto .
also , as part of the summit , the bloc 's foreign defence ministers met in advance to approve the 2013  |||  action  |||  plan , which seeks to strengthen dialogue and consensus on defence in the region .
peru has the pro tempore presidency of the regional  |||  bloc  |||  .
" south america should  |||  learn  |||  from europe to integrate citizenship " says rafael correa
the president of ecuador , rafael correa , said today that the creation of a common citizenship is a goal that " south america , in this case , must  |||  learn  |||  from europe . "
to this end , he defended the project to establish south american citizenship  |||  encouraged  |||  by member countries of unasur .
" we have to achieve the  |||  free  |||  movement of citizens and workers for any south american country , as is already the situation with members of the andean community . however , there are still reactionary sectors that want us to return to the past " he said .
the ecuadorian president was also in favour of the restructuring of the organisation of  |||  american  |||  states ( oas ) under the premise of reducing the influence of the anglo - saxon states and taking into account those who have signed the pact of san josé on human rights .
those who speak with authority never commit to anything , whereas we south americans  |||  sign  |||  everything .
" it is incomprehensible that the inter - american commission on human rights is in washington under us funding " he said referring to ecuador giving political  |||  asylum  |||  to wikileaks founder julian assange .
correa said he does not regret that decision because with it he has not betrayed his principles , but has  |||  respected  |||  his " deep democratic and human rights values . "
additionally , he criticised the swedish courts for demanding that he be subject to questioning for an alleged sexual offence in his country , when " swedish legislation  |||  itself  |||  dictates that he can be questioned via videoconference , which could be done from the ecuadorian embassy in london . "
correa said that there is a risk of deterioration of assange 's  |||  physical  |||  and mental health .
" i have not spoken to him since he was at our embassy , but the ambassador informed me that he had a minor lung problem , nothing  |||  serious  |||  " said the ecuadorian president .
" that would complicate the health of any person " he  |||  added  |||  .
correa said that the solution to the  |||  asylum  |||  granted to assange in june by the ecuadorian embassy , in london , through the issue of a safe - conduct pass that permits travel to ecuador , is in the hands of great britain , sweden and the european legal authorities , and stressed that there have been talks with london to seek a solution to the imprisonment of the wikileaks founder .
we do not negotiate with human rights , we do not use that word in this case , but there have been ongoing  |||  discussions  |||  .
" the solution to this problem is in the hands of great britain , sweden and the european legal authorities , because assange 's lawyer , baltazar garzon , is handling a series of cases in  |||  different  |||  european courts " he said .
and if sweden , as its  |||  legislation  |||  perfectly well allows it to do , and as it has done in other cases , questions mr assange at the embassy of ecuador in london , or interrogates him via skype tomorrow , this problem is over .
correa took the opportunity to reassert himself as a defender of freedom of the press and stated that what he does not tolerate is " the mediocrity , dishonesty and lies that  |||  undermine  |||  the freedom of expression . "
" the greatest enemies of the press freedom are not evil and wicked politicians , but bad journalists depending on  |||  profit  |||  , blackmail and extortion " he said .
correa also  |||  supported  |||  the decision to maintain the veto on paraguay in unasur , at least until their next elections , arguing that the body " must be firm and not tolerate opportunism and a coup masked with legality " because this will in fact " destroy the legitimacy of paraguayan democracy . "
the ecuadorian president also  |||  considered  |||  the " perfectly pertinent " desire of his colombian counterpart , juan manuel santos , to now negotiate with nicaragua the maritime boundary between the two countries , after the ruling of the international court of justice in the hague , in favour nicaraguan maritime sovereignty .
for now that  |||  ruling  |||  is not being followed .
conflict is  |||  inevitable  |||  , but must be overcome by the desire to walk together .
they need to be processed in a comprehensive manner to overcome them and  |||  move  |||  forward .
additionally , he trusted in a sound conclusion to the maritime boundary dispute opposing peru and chile in the same court and said that " it is right for latin america to refer to international courts if both countries agree to accept losing , however  |||  hard  |||  it may be . "
with reference to the possibility of his standing as a candidate in the upcoming presidential elections in ecuador seeking a third consecutive term , he said he sees that possibility " with much optimism and joy , although at times it is pretty  |||  hard  |||  . "
correa said that if he loses the elections in february 2013 , he will retire from  |||  public  |||  life .
personally , i 've never been interested in  |||  power  |||  , but in situations as unjust as those in ecuador , socio - economic poverty can only be corrected by political power .
" my political movement believed that it was me who ensured that probable victory , so we have to  |||  accept  |||  that responsibility " he said .
" it 's a  |||  decision  |||  " he confirmed .
correa also referred to venezuelan president hugo chavez 's new health  |||  treatment  |||  in cuba .
i just spoke with venezuelan vice president nicolás maduro and he tells me that chavez went for treatment that was already  |||  planned  |||  , routine treatment , and it was expected he would win the campaign and return to cuba .
" this does not mean a  |||  health  |||  relapse for president chavez " he said .
deaths caused by aids are nowadays due to  |||  late  |||  detection
fabrizio was 21 years old when they confirmed his test  |||  result  |||  : hiv positive .
" it was like a bomb dropped on me " he says , recalling the time of the announcement , which the doctor was trying to make " softer , "  |||  apparently  |||  unsuccessfully .
he decided to care for his illness alone and began to  |||  learn  |||  about it ; thanks to his efforts he has just celebrated his 43rd birthday .
he is undoubtedly one of the oldest patients in the hiv unit of the guadalajara  |||  civil  |||  hospital ( chg ) , where he arrived in 1994 after several battles with his health .
fabrizio has lived with the human immunodeficiency virus ( hiv ) for 22 years , hard to imagine in the early '90s , when there were many questions , few treatment options and a great  |||  deal  |||  of stigma .
then , even the director of an imss [  |||  mexican  |||  social security institute ] clinic refused to discharge him " because he had a cut . "
at that time , having aids was synonymous with  |||  death  |||  .
however , many people are still unaware of their illness , and only seek help when the virus has already  |||  caused  |||  havoc , " exhausted " their immune systems and they are suffering from opportunistic infections .
31 years after of the onset of aids around the world , at least since the first reported cases , " the great achievement at this time is that the life expectancy of patients starting treatment in good time and the life expectancy of the general population is exactly equal " stated the head of the chg hiv unit , jaime andrade villanueva ,  |||  saying  |||  that this information was endorsed in april this year in a prestigious scientific journal .
infectious disease specialist and expert in hiv / aids , andrade villanueva said that since 2008 scientists had  |||  concluded  |||  that aids was not a death sentence , but that life expectancy and quality of life depend on the degree of damage to the immune system that patients present when they are diagnosed , with a higher life expectancy for non - drug users : up to 30 years for patients with a 200 cd 4 count and 50 years for those reporting a 500 cd 4 count .
to gauge this progress , it should be remembered that the  |||  average  |||  life expectancy of mexicans today is 76 years .
although mortality has dropped significantly in recent years and , in the case of mexico , the  |||  number  |||  of people dying of aids has fallen from 6,678 in 2007 to 4,862 in 2011 ( unaids annual report ) , it is also true that since the advent of aids , 60 per cent of patients in the national database have died .
in jalisco alone , only 255 people died in 2011 , and there have been 187 deaths up to may of this year ; however , we are assured that there has been  |||  universal  |||  access to antiretroviral drugs since 2005 .
- i think the problem is not to do with access to  |||  treatment  |||  .
that 's how i view it , and that 's how it 's been at our  |||  hospital  |||  .
for at least the  |||  last  |||  12 years we 've had no shortage of medicine , the problem is that patients arrive in an advanced state of illness because they are unaware of their hiv status , that is to say , the later stages of the disease .
he gave a compelling statistic : " nine out of ten patients arrive when they already have an opportunistic infection , so what needs to be done to have a greater impact on overall mortality is to make earlier diagnoses and , therefore ,  |||  offer  |||  mass detection tests for everyone who needs them . "
specialists and officials of the state council of aids prevention in jalisco ( coesida ) agree on this proposal , as do the patients themselves , such as fabrizio , who  |||  came  |||  to be tested at a private laboratory , motivated only because a friend had done so and , despite his young age , he was around in the aids era and had even suffered kaposi sarcoma , a cancerous tumour that is one of the common complications .
some people think they 're going to die and do n't want to know  |||  anything  |||  .
to date , his parents are only aware he had  |||  cancer  |||  .
i live as  |||  normal  |||  a life as anyone else .
" i work , i take part in a lot of activities , i travel , i have an active but  |||  responsible  |||  sex life , i take care of myself and the other person " said fabrizio , who agreed to share his intimate secrets with milenio jalisco , to motivate those people with his story who today , in the context of world aids day , are afraid .
they should get tested if they are at risk . because the sooner they know if they are hiv positive , the better , and if they have already been diagnosed , they must learn to live like any other person , while being  |||  responsible  |||  .
this is his  |||  message  |||  , which summarises the theme of the fight against aids in 2012 .
|||  condoms  |||  behind the counter .
the gaps between health programmes and  |||  ordinary  |||  citizens are huge , said ricardo salazar , a journalist from guadalajara who has taken up the hiv cause .
in places dedicated to this task " the distribution of condoms has actually  |||  increased  |||  ; previously , they used to give us one or two , now they give us packets of a hundred , and that 's fine , but it turns out there are still people out there who have no access condoms " he said .
" why do you want them ? " is a common question , asked with sarcasm and judged according to the values of social workers , counsellors , pharmacy workers and healthcare  |||  staff  |||  who do not want to expose teenagers to sex , said the speaker .
it was decided to  |||  change  |||  such inefficient allocation , and that condoms should not only be placed behind counters , but that packets of one hundred should be found in public toilet dispensers in places frequented by young people .
this is not  |||  promoting  |||  promiscuity .
there are 13,435 cumulative  |||  cases  |||  ( 12,158 aids and 1,317 hiv ) .
the  |||  state  |||  is 4th in the nation in new and cumulative cases of aids and 13th in hiv .
an estimated 50,000 people may be  |||  living  |||  with hiv , as for each registered case there are around 4-5 people who do not know they are positive .
ratified by a united states court of  |||  appeal  |||  , a judgement which ignores the restructuring of the vitro group 's debt achieved via a bankruptcy in mexico , the scenario is an ominous precedent for any national company with offices in the neighbouring country that has solvency problems .
it seems , then , that the proceedings in support of survival of firms permit mexican law are not valid in the  |||  land  |||  of stars and stripes , contrary to international conventions .
in practical terms , the endorsement of the judgement delivered on 15 june by judge harlin hale of the bankruptcy court of the northern district of texas , leaves mexican firms defenceless against  |||  possible  |||  seizure of their property outside of mexico .
indeed , the un model law for international trade law uniformity was  |||  created  |||  for this purpose , with the american law institute positioned as arbitrator .
secondly , the judgement establishes that without the intercompany vote , with the debts the vitro subsidiaries had with their parent company  |||  recognised  |||  in the critical mass of the insolvency , the majority needed to approve the restructuring might not be achieved .
however ,  |||  mexican  |||  law recognises the possibility .
in fact , the vitro case was not the first one in which the scheme was  |||  accepted  |||  .
there are half a dozen examples , including agremex and commercial mexicana ,  |||  whose  |||  intercompany debts were endorsed by the federal bankruptcy institute .
what is also certain is that , not including the votes of subsidiaries , the vitro creditors who fought against it in the us courts , namely " vulture " funds such as aurelios capital , aurelios convergence , elliot international and liverpool  |||  limited  |||  , did not achieve a majority .
the  |||  vote  |||  was apparently 45 percent versus 37 .
from another perspective , the latter blames vitro for the difficult situation it has faced since 2008 , while trying to avoid the  |||  severe  |||  economic crisis faced by the united states , turning its back on the country .
for now , the gonzalez sada family firm has lodged a motion for reconsideration before the court of  |||  appeal  |||  for the vote to reach the plenary of the court , that is , the five judges , given that only three voted previously .
double whammy : vitro hit and  |||  country  |||  hit .
with the complaints put on the table by the unions of mexicana airlines against the  |||  former  |||  owner of the company , gastón azcárraga andrade , who is accused of mismanagement , dormant for several months , the airline pilots union association already found the bottleneck .
the proceedings headed by carlos diaz chavez morineau has just filed a criminal complaint against the  |||  national  |||  banking and securities commission , which is accused of obstructing justice .
the claim is that the supervisory authority has consistently refused to provide reports to the attorney  |||  general  |||  's office on a transaction carried out by the employer to remove 198 million pesos from trust f / 589 of banco ixe , on behalf of mexicana de aviación .
the resources were apparently channelled towards the  |||  purchase  |||  of shares in the company administradora profesional de hoteles .
as you know , azcarraga andrade is the main shareholder of the posadas hotel  |||  chain  |||  .
a group of local and foreign environmentalists , academics , businessmen and members of the public gathered at the weekend at a forum at the university of the caribbean to approve the creation of a broad front to oppose the opening of the  |||  chinese  |||  dragon mart in cancun .
as you know , we are  |||  talking  |||  about a huge sales and distribution centre in mexico , central america and the caribbean , selling chinese products , with a residential area at the bottom for employees of 150 companies .
previously , canacintra had  |||  managed  |||  to unite the governors of the southeast of mexico to oppose the monumental building that destroyed part of a protected area and represents the mother of all threats to industry .
the government ignored an order of the senate to explain under what terms and conditions the mexican ambassador in japan signed the anti - counterfeiting trade agreement ,  |||  known  |||  by its acronym acta , according to the mexican institute of industrial property , and the matter has already been archived .
as you know , the action was taken even though the senate had ruled out the possibility , deeming it an infringement of freedom of  |||  expression  |||  on social networks .

hector " hetin " reyes : " basketball has been my  |||  life  |||  "
basketball globetrotter hector " hetin " reyes was involved in the sport for over 60 years and , thanks to it , travelled the  |||  world  |||  .
few people in puerto rico have a mental recollection of local basketball  |||  history  |||  as broad as that of héctor " hetin " reyes .
reyes was immersed in the sport for over 60 years before being confined to a wheelchair in 2008 following a stroke ; he was a minor league player ,  |||  national  |||  superior basketball player , bsn representative and manager with the bayamón vaqueros or president of the basketball federation .
" i wore lots of hats in basketball throughout my life , including several at the same time , like when i was president of the bsn ,  |||  general  |||  manager and federative president of the national team during the '90s , " recalled reyes during primera hora 's visit to his home in bayamón , where he lives with isabel , his loyal wife for over 50 years .
" basketball has been my  |||  life  |||  . "
the walls of his house are almost totally decorated with pictures and memorabilia denoting his  |||  long  |||  career , which goes to prove it .
bayamón at  |||  heart  |||
of them all , the ones he treasures with the most emotion are the ones that remind him of his time spent with the vaqueros , from the mid - 50s as a player  |||  until  |||  1982 , when he completed 15 years serving as co - agent or agent of the franchise .
" those were my best years , the ones i enjoyed the most because i had the opportunity to be  |||  part  |||  of the vaqueros ' eight championships , since 1967 , either as agent , co - agent or manager .
there were many good  |||  years  |||  , including the five consecutive championships from 1971 to 1975 .
i  |||  remember  |||  that gene bartow , who had directed here and was at the university of alabama ( birmingham ) , said to me ' i 've got a very strong player for you , 6'7 " tall .
and that was the beginning of mincy , one of the best players puerto rico  |||  ever  |||  had .
i remember him saying that if mincy had given bayamon one championship , gausse would help get  |||  another  |||  .
for that time , he preferred to  |||  enjoy  |||  his own and mincy 's accomplishments in the national team .
i remember when we beat the  |||  united  |||  states for the first time during the 1989 pre - olympics in mexico .
then came the 1990 world cup , where we came fourth and it should have been bronze , but for the canadian referee who made us repeat the  |||  final  |||  play for the second time , said reyes .
is the 1990 world national team the best you 've ever  |||  seen  |||  ?
it 's one of the best , as good as the one that beat the dream team in the 2004  |||  olympics  |||  .
however , my favourite was the one in the 1991 pan american games in cuba , when we won gold and gave the us team a beating , which was quite  |||  similar  |||  to the time we won bronze at the world cup .
a team that maybe was not the best in terms of members , but which gave us a  |||  gold  |||  medal and was a great joy to work with , was the 1995 pre - olympic team in neuquen , argentina .
with role players such as ' canito ' nieves , pablo alicea and the young rolando hourruitiner replacing the players suspended after the shambles of the mar del plata pan - american games , we won  |||  gold  |||  against all the odds .
who was the  |||  best  |||  puerto rican player ?
nobody in puerto rico has dominated at that  |||  level  |||  like piculín did .
not to mention his career in the  |||  various  |||  leagues he played in .
what do you  |||  consider  |||  your greatest achievement in the federation ?
having been part of the national team 's most glorious era between 1988 and 1995 and in the  |||  early  |||  90s the bsn had up to 17 teams in a season .
there were  |||  things  |||  i 'd have liked to implement , such as regionalising the minor leagues .
for example , the boys of ponce only play in their area and only get to face teams from other parts of the island in the  |||  national  |||  playoffs .
right now the  |||  kids  |||  are riding and playing too much , unnecessarily .
larry hagman ,  |||  born  |||  on 21 september 1931 in fort worth ( texas ) , became world famous for his role as john ross ewing , better known as " jr , " in the television series " dallas , " in which he played a ruthless , malicious and manipulative businessman .
larry hagman , whose role as oil tycoon predator jr ewing in the television  |||  series  |||  " dallas " became a symbol of greed in the 1980s , has died .
hagman , who returned this year as jr in a new season of " dallas , " died on friday afternoon of cancer complications , according to a family statement  |||  provided  |||  to the associated press by the warner bros . , producer of " dallas . "
" larry was back in his beloved hometown of dallas , once again representing the iconic role he most liked " the  |||  family  |||  said .
larry 's  |||  family  |||  and closest friends were with him in dallas for the thanksgiving day holiday .
linda gray , who played his  |||  wife  |||  in the original series and the sequel , was with hagman when he died in a hospital in dallas , said her publicist , jeffrey lane .
he was creative ,  |||  generous  |||  , funny , loving and talented , and i will miss him dearly .
" he was an original guy and lived life to the  |||  full  |||  " said gray in a statement .
hagman was diagnosed with cirrhosis of the liver in 1992 and  |||  admitted  |||  that he had drunk a lot over the years .
in 1995 a malignant tumour as found in his liver and he underwent a  |||  transplant  |||  .
he played captain tony nelson , an astronaut whose life is changed when he meets an attractive genie , played by barbara eden , and takes her  |||  home  |||  to live with him .
his film work  |||  included  |||  roles well received by critics in " the group , " " harry and tonto " and " primary colors . "
but it was his masterful interpretation of delightfully detestable jr that led to hagman reaching his  |||  peak  |||  of stardom .
the drama  |||  series  |||  on cbs about the ewing clan and other characters in their orbit aired from april 1978 to may 1991 .
the tagline " who shot jr ? , " designed to generate hype around an episode  |||  full  |||  of emotions in which hagman 's character is nearly killed , generated international speculation and millions of risky dollars wagered in gaming establishments .
it also  |||  helped  |||  give the series a record audience at the time .
when the answer was revealed in an episode in november 1980 , an  |||  average  |||  of 41 million viewers tuned in and made " dallas " the second most watched entertainment programme in history , after the final episode of " mash " in 1983 , which had 50 million viewers .
it was jr 's sister - in - law kristin (  |||  played  |||  by mary crosby ) who shot him .
hagman portrayed ewing as a corrupt insatiable man with a charismatic smile : a dishonest entrepreneur and cheating husband who  |||  tried  |||  to have his alcoholic wife , sue ellen ( linda gray ) , sectioned .
victoria principal , co - star of the original  |||  series  |||  , recalled hagman on friday as someone " huge , on and off screen . "
he is unforgettable and irreplaceable , for millions of fans around the world , and in the hearts of  |||  each  |||  one of us who was fortunate enough to know and love him .
ten episodes of the new edition of " dallas " were broadcast a few months ago with great  |||  success  |||  for tnt .
he had already finished recording five episodes for the second series and a sixth was in process , the chain  |||  reported  |||  .
|||  immediately  |||  after , there was no statement from warner or tnt about how the series would handle the loss of hagman .
martin was still a teenager when she had him in 1931 during her marriage to  |||  lawyer  |||  ben hagman .
while there , he met the young  |||  swedish  |||  designer maj axelsson and married her .
after his liver transplant , he became an organ donation promoter and worked as a volunteer at a hospital ,  |||  helping  |||  fearful patients .
he was also an  |||  anti  |||  - smoking activist and took part in several campaigns .
|||  start  |||  of a course that explores the " end of the world "
|||  each  |||  week , students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war , zombies , viruses and germs , and global warming .
this term , when professor of religion , stuart charmé , decided to give a course on the end of the world , he knew he had a compelling hook : the end of the " long countdown " of the mayan calendar , 21 december , which had convinced many people that the end of the world was  |||  coming  |||  .
but charmé had no idea what awaited him over the next couple of months : the cataclysmic hurricane sandy , a fiscal precipice some called " debt armageddon " and a  |||  growing  |||  conflict involving israel , where end - of - the - world christians theorists think the apocalypse will begin .
" i did n't realise this was going to be the most apocalyptic term  |||  ever  |||  " said charmé this week to students at rutgers - camden university ( new jersey ) .
if you look at what has been  |||  happening  |||  in the world today as if we were at 30 days and counting , this has been a really good period .
and  |||  remember  |||  that bad is good for those with an apocalyptic mentality .
and he is not the only professor who offers courses on the " end of the world " this term , theoretically the  |||  last  |||  in history .
|||  each  |||  week , students explore apocalyptic themes such as nuclear war , zombies , viruses and germs , and global warming .
" we looked at why these ideas proliferate over time " he said , and how they  |||  offer  |||  hypothetical scenarios that guide human behaviour .
if nuclear  |||  material  |||  falls into the hands of terrorists , for example , a war could break out .
this month students analysed movies with an apocalyptic theme and explored how they compare with  |||  real  |||  - life examples .
at the main pennsylvania state  |||  university  |||  campus , latin american history professor matthew restall , and his colleague amara solari , an associate art history and anthropology professor , have teamed up to give a course , called simply " the end of the world . "
despite the " impending doom , " students have to study , undertake projects and take  |||  final  |||  exams .
at penn state , the  |||  final  |||  exam will be taken on the eve of the apocalypse , which leaves students no choice but to work " until the very night the world is supposed to end " said restall .
the courses proved quite  |||  popular  |||  .
" it was fully booked within two hours " said restall , on his course for students with  |||  high  |||  averages , which was filled with 35 students .
we received emails for weeks and weeks  |||  before  |||  the start of the term , from people asking if there were any places .
students , meanwhile , say the  |||  course  |||  is one of the most interesting around .
" i find it fascinating to see what people do to console  |||  themselves  |||  " said bridgid robinson , a 23 - year - old post - graduate religion and sociology student from haddonfield , new jersey , at rutgers - camden .
and the apocalyptic , secular or religious mentality is just a  |||  matter  |||  consolation or a lack of it .
will wekesa , a 25 - year - old post - graduate psychology and nursing student , said he had seen all the apocalyptic  |||  movies  |||  .
" i 'd never  |||  heard  |||  of a class that could teach it " he said .
but none of the students interviewed - much less any professor - said they believed in the end  |||  date  |||  of december 21st .
" our first project was about the mayan prophecy and to a certain extent we discredited it " said julie zeglen , a 21 - year - old  |||  final  |||  year student at temple , from west chester .
the mayans never predicted the end of the world : it is just a key  |||  point  |||  in the calendar , said restall .
but he said that western culture suffers from apocalyptic anxiety , which goes back several centuries , in which people react to changes  |||  around  |||  them by predicting the end of the world .
the internet has  |||  caused  |||  a boom in these speculations .
joseph dougherty , a professor of religion at la salle  |||  university  |||  , who is giving courses in the philippines this year , responded quickly to the question of whether he knew about any courses on the " end of the world " there .
" the philippines are not taking part in the end of the world " he wrote , suggesting an exception of a higher  |||  authority  |||  .
restall  |||  noted  |||  that over the years there has been talk of many days of the last judgement , and said that if nothing happens on december 21st , " people will immediately start thinking of the next date " or philosophising that december 21st is the beginning of a seven - year period after which the world will end .
students and teachers are taking the  |||  date  |||  lightly .
some said they plan to go to " end of the  |||  world  |||  " parties .
" maybe i 'll call some friends so we can have a laugh together " said samira ford , 20 - year - old  |||  communications  |||  student .
